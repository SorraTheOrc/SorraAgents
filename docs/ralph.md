# Ralph orchestration loop

`ralph` is a deterministic implement→audit orchestration loop for a target Worklog item.

## Overview

Ralph drives an iterative cycle of:

1. **Implement** — delegate implementation of the target work item (+ direct children) via the `implement` skill.
2. **Audit** — run the `audit` skill and persist structured results.
3. **Remediate** — if audit finds unmet or partial criteria, feed those into the next implement pass.
4. **Repeat** until audit passes, max attempts are reached, or the operator cancels.

## Usage

```bash
python skill/ralph/scripts/ralph_loop.py <work-item-id> [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--max-attempts` | 10 | Maximum number of implement→audit cycles before giving up. |
| `--check-cmd` | (none) | Build/test command(s) to run after a successful audit. Can be specified multiple times. |
| `--confirm-merge` | off | Execute `git fetch`, `git merge --ff-only`, `git push` after successful audit and checks. **Without this flag, no merge side effects occur.** |
| `--cancel-file` | (none) | Path checked each attempt; if the file exists, the loop stops with status `cancelled`. |
| `--quiet` | off | Suppress all console output and pi streaming; only print the final JSON result. |
| `--verbose` | off | Show detailed delegation commands, subprocess stdout/stderr, and raw audit output. |
| `--no-stream` | off | Don't stream pi subprocess output to console (use buffered capture). Progress logging still shown. |
| `--pi-bin` | `pi` | Path to the `pi` binary for delegating implement and audit. |
| `--wl-bin` | `wl` | Path to the `wl` binary for worklog operations. |

### Preconditions

- **Stage gate**: The target work item must be at stage `plan_complete`. If not, ralph exits with an error.
- **Scope**: Only the target item and its direct children are processed.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success — audit passed, checks passed, merge offered |
| 2 | Error — precondition failure or command error |
| 3 | Cancelled — cancel file detected |
| 4 | Max attempts reached — loop exhausted without success |

## Merge Safety Model

Ralph will **never** merge or push without explicit operator confirmation:

- Without `--confirm-merge`: ralph reports success and notes that merge is available, but performs **no git operations**.
- With `--confirm-merge`: ralph executes `git fetch origin main`, `git merge --ff-only origin/main`, and `git push origin HEAD`.
- If any git step fails (e.g., permission denied, push rejected), ralph raises a clear error.

## Console Output

By default, ralph prints two kinds of output to the console:

1. **Structured progress messages** (logger at INFO level): lifecycle events like attempt start, audit result, merge decision, etc.
2. **Pi subprocess streaming**: the stdout of `pi run` commands is echoed to the console in real-time, line by line, so you can see implement and audit progress as it happens.

This means during an implement or audit pass, you'll see the pi agent's output appear in your terminal as it works — just as if you'd run `pi run` yourself.

Use `--quiet` to suppress all progress output and pi streaming — only the final JSON result is printed. Useful for scripted invocations.

Use `--no-stream` to keep progress logging but disable pi output streaming (output is still captured, just not echoed to the console).

Use `--verbose` to see detailed delegation information in addition to streaming:

- Every `wl`, `pi`, `git`, and `bash` command before it runs
- Subprocess output (first 1000 chars of stdout/stderr for check and merge commands)
- Full pi run prompts (logged under `prompt_full`)
- Pi run output (first 1000 chars)
- Raw audit output (first 1000 chars) and parsed criteria details
- Comment counts and work item stage/status from worklog commands

Typical `--verbose` output includes:

```
DEBUG ralph ralph.cmd.wl.show cmd=['wl', 'show', 'SA-1234', '--json', '--children']
DEBUG ralph ralph.cmd.wl.show id=SA-1234 stage=plan_complete status=open children=1
DEBUG ralph ralph.cmd.pi.run prompt_len=142
DEBUG ralph ralph.cmd.pi.run prompt_full=
implement SA-1234
Target scope includes direct children only: SA-5678.
Continue until scope items are in_review, but do not merge.
DEBUG ralph ralph.cmd.pi.run stdout_len=2048 stdout_start=Audit report...
DEBUG ralph ralph.loop.audit.raw_output target=SA-1234 attempt=1 len=2048 output_start=Ready to close: No...
DEBUG ralph ralph.loop.audit.parsed target=SA-1234 attempt=1 ready=False criteria_count=3 unmet=2
```

## Observability

Ralph emits structured log events at key lifecycle points using the `ralph` Python logger:

| Event | Level | Data |
|-------|-------|------|
| `ralph.loop.start` | INFO | target, scope, max_attempts |
| `ralph.loop.attempt.start` | INFO | target, attempt number |
| `ralph.loop.audit.start` | INFO | target, attempt |
| `ralph.loop.audit.complete` | INFO | target, attempt, ready, unmet count |
| `ralph.loop.remediate` | INFO | target, attempt, unmet_count |
| `ralph.loop.checks.start` | INFO | target |
| `ralph.loop.merge` | INFO | target, confirm flag |
| `ralph.loop.cancelled` | INFO | target, attempt |
| `ralph.loop.max_attempts` | WARNING | target |

## Idempotence

- Audit comments are deduplicated by content hash. Re-running ralph with identical audit output will not create duplicate AMPA comments.
- Changed audit content appends a new comment (clear revision, not a duplicate).

## Examples

### Basic run (no merge)

```bash
python skill/ralph/scripts/ralph_loop.py SA-1234 --max-attempts 5
```

### Run with build checks and merge

```bash
python skill/ralph/scripts/ralph_loop.py SA-1234 --check-cmd "pytest -q" --confirm-merge
```

### Run with cancellation support

```bash
python skill/ralph/scripts/ralph_loop.py SA-1234 --cancel-file /tmp/ralph-cancel
# To cancel: touch /tmp/ralph-cancel
```
