The skill must expose a reliable command to trigger it and must follow the exact output format and constraints below.\n\nTrigger command (suggested)\n---------------------------\nUse a single command that reliably invokes the skill. Suggested CLI command:\n\n`opencode skill run risk-and-effort-edtimator`\n\nDraft prompt (to be embedded in the skill)\n----------------------------------------\nYou are an expert engineering estimator. Your task: review the issue and produce risk and effort estimates using recognized best practices (WBS, three-point/PERT, uncertainty, assumptions, risk matrix).\n\nHard constraints:\n- You must NOT ask any follow-up questions.\n- You must NOT assume access to code, repo, logs, or stakeholders.\n- You must work ONLY with the content inside <system-reminder> (treat it as the full issue context). If details are missing, call them out explicitly and choose conservative estimates.\n\nWhat to do:\n1) Restate the issue in 1–2 sentences (to prove understanding).\n2) Identify scope boundaries:\n   - In scope\n   - Out of scope\n3) Build a lightweight work breakdown (WBS) with 5–12 items (design, implementation, tests, docs, rollout, monitoring), noting likely dependencies and unknowns.\n4) Effort estimate (use three-point estimating / PERT):\n   - Provide Optimistic (O), Most Likely (M), Pessimistic (P) in “ideal engineering days” (or hours if very small).\n   - Compute Expected (E) = (O + 4M + P) / 6.\n   - Add “coordination overhead” and “risk buffer” explicitly if warranted (don’t hide it).\n   - Provide a final range (min–max) and a single recommended planning value.\n   - Also provide a T-shirt size (XS/S/M/L/XL) with clear thresholds you define.\n5) Risk estimate (use a probability x impact matrix):\n   - Score Probability (1–5) and Impact (1–5).\n   - Overall Risk Score = Probability * Impact (1–25) and map to: Low (1–5), Medium (6–12), High (13–19), Critical (20–25).\n   - Break risk into categories with 1–2 bullets each: Technical, Product/Requirements, Delivery/Dependencies, Operational/Performance, Security/Compliance.\n   - Include top 3 risk drivers and the best mitigation for each.\n6) Confidence:\n   - Provide confidence % (0–100) with a one-line justification referencing missing info/uncertainty.\n7) If the issue is underspecified, propose a “spike” option:\n   - Spike goal, timebox, and how it would reduce uncertainty (and how estimates would change).\n\nOutput format\n-------------\n- First: a compact JSON block with keys exactly:\n  - effort: { \"unit\": \"ideal_days\", \"tshirt\": \"\", \"o\": 0, \"m\": 0, \"p\": 0, \"expected\": 0, \"recommended\": 0, \"range\": [0,0] }\n  - risk: { \"probability\": 0, \"impact\": 0, \"score\": 0, \"level\": \"\", \"top_drivers\": [], \"mitigations\": [] }\n  - confidence_percent: 0\n  - assumptions: []\n  - unknowns: []\n- Then: a brief narrative (bulleted) explaining the reasoning, WBS, and what would most change the estimates.\n\nIntegration details / constraints\n--------------------------------\n- The skill must accept an input block called <system-reminder> and must use only that content to produce estimates.\n- The skill must never ask follow-up questions; if information is missing it should explicitly list unknowns and choose conservative estimates.\n- The produced JSON must match the key names and types exactly to allow programmatic consumption.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n-------------------\n- Running `opencode skill run risk-and-effort-edtimator` with an input issue containing a <system-reminder> block returns a valid JSON block followed by the narrative.\n- JSON validates against the shape described above and numbers are realistic (non-negative, expected computed correctly).\n- The narrative includes a 5–12 item WBS and top 3 risk drivers with mitigations.\n\nSuggested next steps\n--------------------\n1. Create a GitHub issue from this file (title: \"Risk and Effort Edtimator Skill\").\n2. Add labels: `P0`, `feature`, `spec`.\n3. Assign a product owner (@product-owner) and link to this worklog file.\n4. Implement the skill (prototype using the draft prompt); expose the CLI command `opencode skill run risk-and-effort-edtimator`.\n5. Write automated tests validating JSON output shape and example estimates for 2–3 representative issues.\n\nNotes\n-----\n- This is a top-level P0 issue describing the desired new skill and the exact estimation output format required from the skill.\n- The skill must be conservative by default and must flag missing info rather than inventing it.","effort":"","githubIssueNumber":3,"githubIssueUpdatedAt":"2026-01-28T10:04:31Z","id":"SA-0MKSTQR3H1HLD7HC","issueType":"","parentId":null,"priority":"high","risk":"","stage":"plan_complete","status":"open","tags":["P0","feature","spec"],"title":"Risk and Effort Estimator Skill","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T18:20:27.551Z"},"type":"workitem"}
