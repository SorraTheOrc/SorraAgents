The skill must expose a reliable command to trigger it and must follow the exact output format and constraints below.\n\nTrigger command (suggested)\n---------------------------\nUse a single command that reliably invokes the skill. Suggested CLI command:\n\n`opencode skill run risk-and-effort-edtimator`\n\nDraft prompt (to be embedded in the skill)\n----------------------------------------\nYou are an expert engineering estimator. Your task: review the issue and produce risk and effort estimates using recognized best practices (WBS, three-point/PERT, uncertainty, assumptions, risk matrix).\n\nHard constraints:\n- You must NOT ask any follow-up questions.\n- You must NOT assume access to code, repo, logs, or stakeholders.\n- You must work ONLY with the content inside <system-reminder> (treat it as the full issue context). If details are missing, call them out explicitly and choose conservative estimates.\n\nWhat to do:\n1) Restate the issue in 1–2 sentences (to prove understanding).\n2) Identify scope boundaries:\n   - In scope\n   - Out of scope\n3) Build a lightweight work breakdown (WBS) with 5–12 items (design, implementation, tests, docs, rollout, monitoring), noting likely dependencies and unknowns.\n4) Effort estimate (use three-point estimating / PERT):\n   - Provide Optimistic (O), Most Likely (M), Pessimistic (P) in “ideal engineering days” (or hours if very small).\n   - Compute Expected (E) = (O + 4M + P) / 6.\n   - Add “coordination overhead” and “risk buffer” explicitly if warranted (don’t hide it).\n   - Provide a final range (min–max) and a single recommended planning value.\n   - Also provide a T-shirt size (XS/S/M/L/XL) with clear thresholds you define.\n5) Risk estimate (use a probability x impact matrix):\n   - Score Probability (1–5) and Impact (1–5).\n   - Overall Risk Score = Probability * Impact (1–25) and map to: Low (1–5), Medium (6–12), High (13–19), Critical (20–25).\n   - Break risk into categories with 1–2 bullets each: Technical, Product/Requirements, Delivery/Dependencies, Operational/Performance, Security/Compliance.\n   - Include top 3 risk drivers and the best mitigation for each.\n6) Confidence:\n   - Provide confidence % (0–100) with a one-line justification referencing missing info/uncertainty.\n7) If the issue is underspecified, propose a “spike” option:\n   - Spike goal, timebox, and how it would reduce uncertainty (and how estimates would change).\n\nOutput format\n-------------\n- First: a compact JSON block with keys exactly:\n  - effort: { \"unit\": \"ideal_days\", \"tshirt\": \"\", \"o\": 0, \"m\": 0, \"p\": 0, \"expected\": 0, \"recommended\": 0, \"range\": [0,0] }\n  - risk: { \"probability\": 0, \"impact\": 0, \"score\": 0, \"level\": \"\", \"top_drivers\": [], \"mitigations\": [] }\n  - confidence_percent: 0\n  - assumptions: []\n  - unknowns: []\n- Then: a brief narrative (bulleted) explaining the reasoning, WBS, and what would most change the estimates.\n\nIntegration details / constraints\n--------------------------------\n- The skill must accept an input block called <system-reminder> and must use only that content to produce estimates.\n- The skill must never ask follow-up questions; if information is missing it should explicitly list unknowns and choose conservative estimates.\n- The produced JSON must match the key names and types exactly to allow programmatic consumption.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n-------------------\n- Running `opencode skill run risk-and-effort-edtimator` with an input issue containing a <system-reminder> block returns a valid JSON block followed by the narrative.\n- JSON validates against the shape described above and numbers are realistic (non-negative, expected computed correctly).\n- The narrative includes a 5–12 item WBS and top 3 risk drivers with mitigations.\n\nSuggested next steps\n--------------------\n1. Create a GitHub issue from this file (title: \"Risk and Effort Edtimator Skill\").\n2. Add labels: `P0`, `feature`, `spec`.\n3. Assign a product owner (@product-owner) and link to this worklog file.\n4. Implement the skill (prototype using the draft prompt); expose the CLI command `opencode skill run risk-and-effort-edtimator`.\n5. Write automated tests validating JSON output shape and example estimates for 2–3 representative issues.\n\nNotes\n-----\n- This is a top-level P0 issue describing the desired new skill and the exact estimation output format required from the skill.\n- The skill must be conservative by default and must flag missing info rather than inventing it.","effort":"L","githubIssueNumber":3,"githubIssueUpdatedAt":"2026-02-05T08:46:43Z","id":"SA-0MKSTQR3H1HLD7HC","issueType":"","parentId":"SA-0MKYVWAKU14W795Z","priority":"high","risk":"High","sortIndex":0,"stage":"in_review","status":"completed","tags":["P0","feature","spec"],"title":"Risk and Effort Estimator Skill","updatedAt":"2026-02-05T09:14:52.306Z"},"type":"workitem"}

{"data":{"assignee":"Map","createdAt":"2026-01-28T19:00:23.307Z","createdBy":"","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","dependencies":[],"description":"Problem statement\n---------------\nAgents sometimes encounter failing tests during automated work that originate in code they do not own. There is no consistent, automated process for detecting whether an existing critical work item already captures that failure, creating a critical issue when needed, and recording blocking relationships — which leads to duplicated effort, lost signal, and stalled work.\n\nUsers\n-----\n- Agents (automation) that run tests and make code changes — need a clear, predictable triage flow when they see external failures.\n- Developers/owners of failing code — get consistent, reproducible bug reports with repro steps and CI evidence.\n- PMs / on-call / triage roles — need each critical failure assigned and tracked to resolution so work capacity is not wasted.\n\nSuccess criteria\n----------------\n- When an agent detects a failing test it does NOT own, it automatically searches worklog for an existing open critical issue matching the failure. If none exists, the agent creates one (title + test name + failing output + reproduction steps + suspected owners). (Automation verified by unit/integration tests.)\n- Other work may continue locally, but the existence of any open critical work item blocks creation or merging of any PR (regardless of whether the PR's work item is explicitly recorded as blocked), except for PRs that are intended to close a critical issue and explicitly reference that critical issue ID.\n- Any created critical issue uses the agreed minimal template and is assigned or flagged for triage within X minutes (configurable). Tests validate issue content and linking behavior.\n\nConstraints\n-----------\n - Agents must have permission to create and update work items in wl and to access CI artifacts/links if available.\n- The matching heuristics must be conservative to avoid false positives; agents must not overwrite existing issue fields.\n- The policy must not block non-PR local work; blocking applies only to PR creation/merges as specified.\n\nExisting state\n--------------\n- Current work item: SA-0MKYE4BRF1U5WZLK (this intake) records the seed intent and high-level suggested implementation.\n- Implementation guidance and agent flows reference test-fix requirements in `command/implement.md` (mentions “Fix any failing tests before continuing”).\n- `AGENTS.md` documents dependency tags like `blocked-by:<work-item-id>` which this policy will use for linking.\n- Related operational items: SA-0MKYE40VG1V2DTOX (wl show --thread bug) and SA-0MKYE4G3M0B67053 (PM periodic critical-check) — both are related processes to coordinate with.\n\nDesired change\n--------------\n- Add a helper library/function in the agent toolkit, `check_or_create_critical_issue(failure_signature, evidence)` that:\n  - searches wl for matching open critical issues using default heuristics (title + test name + `test-failure` tag + recent timestamp window),\n  - if found, returns the matching issue id; if not found, creates a critical work item using the minimal template and returns the new id.\n - Update agent workflows to call the helper when detecting external failing tests and then:\n  - prevent creation/merge of PRs for any work item while any open critical issue exists, except for PRs that are intended to close a critical issue and explicitly reference that critical issue ID.\n- Add unit tests for the helper, and an integration test that simulates an agent finding a failing test and confirms the correct WL interactions (search, create, link).\n- Add a short runbook and a template for the created critical issues.\n\nMatching heuristics (default)\n----------------------------\n- Match existing critical issues using these checks (in order):\n  1. Exact test name + `test-failure` tag + open status within the last 72 hours.\n  2. Title similarity (token overlap) with test name and matching stacktrace top-frame.\n  3. CI job URL or failing commit hash matches an open critical issue.\n- If multiple candidates match, prefer the most recent open issue; if ambiguity remains, attach a comment to the most recent candidate and alert triage.\n\nCritical issue template (minimal required fields)\n-----------------------------------------------\n- Title: `[test-failure] <test-name> — <short-failure-summary>`\n- Body fields (required):\n  - Test name\n  - Failing output / short stderr snippet\n  - Reproduction steps (may be multi-step; must be sufficient for a developer to re-run the failure)\n  - Suspected owner(s) or area labels (if detectable)\n  - Failing commit hash (if available)\n  - Attach logs or link to an archive if larger than inline limits\n\nRelated work\n------------\n- `command/implement.md` — agent guidance mentioning test-fix expectations (path: `command/implement.md`).\n- `AGENTS.md` — dependency tagging and conventions (path: `AGENTS.md`).\n- SA-0MKYE40VG1V2DTOX — `Agent error: 'wl show --thread' missing when running /impplement` (operational bug to coordinate with). \n- SA-0MKYE4G3M0B67053 — `PM duty: periodic check for critical issues and immediate assignment` (process for assignment/triage).\n\nAcceptance criteria (detailed)\n-----------------------------\n1. Automated tests: unit tests for `check_or_create_critical_issue` covering match, create, and conflict resolution; one integration test that simulates an agent run creating or linking to a critical issue and marking WIP linked/updated.\n2. When an agent detects an external failing test, it automatically searches and creates a critical issue per the template if none exists. The created issue is priority `critical`, tagged `test-failure`, and includes required fields (including reproduction steps).\n3. When an agent finds an existing critical issue it should update/improve the issue description with any new information discovered from the failure. Creation or merging of any PR is blocked while any critical issue remains open, except for PRs that explicitly aim to close a critical issue and reference its id in the PR description.\n4. A short runbook and template file are added to the repo (path: `/.opencode/triage/test-failure-template.md`) describing fields and triage steps.\n\nRisks & mitigations\n--------------------\n- Risk: False positives — a matching heuristic may incorrectly match unrelated failures, causing unnecessary blocking.\n  - Mitigation: Conservative heuristics (exact test name + `test-failure` tag + 72h window) and prefer recent issues; provide an override path for humans to un-block when needed.\n- Risk: Flaky tests cause noise and frequent critical issues.\n  - Mitigation: Add optional CI re-check or a flakiness score; include flakiness flag in issues and route to a separate triage queue.\n- Risk: Agents lack permissions to read CI metadata or create issues.\n  - Mitigation: Add a startup check that verifies required permissions and fails fast with a clear error message.\n\n\n\nNotes / Open questions\n----------------------\n- Do you want the agent to re-run CI automatically (flaky-check) before creating a critical issue? Current default: no — agents create issues immediately on deterministic failures; CI re-check could be added as an enhancement. \n- Who should be the default assignee or triage role for newly-created critical issues (e.g., `@oncall`, `@pm`, or leave unassigned)? Current draft requires triage within a configurable time window but does not auto-assign a specific person by default.","effort":"","githubIssueNumber":19,"githubIssueUpdatedAt":"2026-02-05T08:47:20Z","id":"SA-0MKYE4BRF1U5WZLK","issueType":"feature","parentId":"SA-0MKYVWAKU14W795Z","priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":0,"stage":"plan_complete","status":"open","tags":[],"title":"Agent policy: create/check critical issue when encountering failing tests not owned","updatedAt":"2026-02-05T09:14:52.308Z"},"type":"workitem"}

The APMA's responsibility is to ensure clarity of plan, break down work into actionable tasks, assign or delegate those tasks, and monitor progress — it does not implement code changes or directly modify repositories.\n\nGoal / Scope:\nThe APMA intake flow accepts briefs and performs discovery to surface candidate work, creates clear work definitions (analysis, design, implementation spec, test plan, docs), and delegates those tasks to appropriate agents or teams. It sequences and coordinates work, triggers or requests non-destructive checks (builds/tests in read-only mode), and reports status, risks, and blockers. All code or repository modifications are executed by delegated agents (people or automation) under explicit approval policies.\n\nUser stories:\n- As a product lead, I want the APMA to turn a high-level brief into a clear plan with defined tasks and assignees so work can start without ambiguous follow-ups.\n- As an engineer or sub-agent, I want the APMA to produce unambiguous child work-items (analysis, design spec, implementation spec, tests, docs) with acceptance criteria so I can execute my assigned work with minimal additional discovery.\n- As a stakeholder, I want the APMA to delegate work to named agents, maintain an audit trail of delegation actions, and produce regular progress reports so I can monitor delivery.\n- As a safety officer, I want the APMA to default to read-only discovery and never perform destructive repo operations without explicit separate approval.\n\nExpected behaviour / outcomes:\n- The APMA discovers and ranks candidate items from `idea` stage, runs readiness checks, and returns a clear recommended plan with proposed child tasks and suggested assignees/agent-groups.\n- The APMA can create draft child work-items or add delegation comments in `wl` to record what should be done and who should do it; it may assign tasks to agent identities but will not perform repository pushes, merges, or direct code edits.\n- The APMA coordinates non-destructive operations (CI runs in dry-run mode, linting, static analysis) and attaches results to work-items; any mutating repository actions are delegated and require separate approvals.\n- The APMA generates progress summaries (open/blocked items, percent complete, top risks) and maintains an auditable comment trail for decisions and delegations.\n- The APMA can also generate new ideas for exploration (research spikes, prototypes, alternative approaches) and surface them as candidate `idea`-stage work-items for further discovery.\n- The APMA can respond clearly about the status of any particular work-item or group of work-items, providing current stage, recent activity, assigned agents, blockers, and next recommended actions.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1) Given a project brief, the APMA creates an epic with child work-items that define discovery tasks, analysis, design, implementation spec, testing, and documentation steps with measurable acceptance criteria in `wl`.\n2) The APMA can produce a delegation plan for a selected work-item: a list of proposed child tasks, suggested assignee agent-groups, and the rationale for each delegation (verify: `wl show` and comments reflect proposed tasks and rationale).\n3) The APMA provides read-only discovery by default; `propose` or `delegate` actions create draft child work-items or comments but do not modify code repositories. Any `apply` mode that triggers repository changes must be explicitly approved and executed by delegated agents.\n4) The APMA produces human-readable progress reports and an audit trail of delegation actions attached to the relevant work-items.\n\nSuggested implementation approach:\n- Phase 1 (define): Create PRD, agent responsibilities, safety/permission model, and minimal architecture (core controller + plug-in subagents for wl, delegation, reporting).\n- Phase 2 (MVP): Implement intake parser, discovery scorer, task composer, delegation planner (creates draft child work-items and comments), and reporting module. Keep all repo-affecting steps as outputs for delegated agents.\n- Phase 3 (operate): Integrate with sub-agents (analysis-agent, design-agent, dev-agent, test-agent), refine delegation mappings, and add audit and reporting enhancements.\n\nDeliverables:\n- PRD and design doc stored in the repo describing discovery/definition/delegation model and safety policy.\n- APMA components (service/CLI) that implement the MVP acceptance criteria above, but do not perform direct repository mutations.\n- Tests validating `wl` creations, proposed delegations, and reporting behavior.\n\nNotes / constraints:\n- APMA is non-destructive by default: repository changes are outside its remit and must be performed by delegates under separate approvals.\n- Follow repo conventions for task naming, branch suggestions, and commit message drafts; these should be provided as outputs for delegates, not applied by APMA.\n- Maintain clear audit logs in work-items when delegations or proposals are created.\n\nAcceptance test steps:\n- Run APMA with a sample brief and verify an epic is created with well-defined child tasks: `wl show <epic-id>`.\n- Verify the APMA produced a delegation plan and comments suggesting assignees/agent-groups for child tasks.\n- Confirm APMA's operations did not perform any repository pushes or merges; repository-affecting steps are present as delegated outputs only.\n- Generate the APMA progress report and confirm it lists open/blocked items, percent complete, and top risks.\n\nRelated: SA-0ML5E7ZHH0Y5VJQE (select-next-intake-ready-item) and other skills that focus on discovery and delegation.","effort":"","githubIssueNumber":37,"githubIssueUpdatedAt":"2026-02-05T08:49:01Z","id":"SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR","issueType":"epic","parentId":null,"priority":"high","risk":"","sortIndex":200,"stage":"prd_complete","status":"open","tags":[],"title":"Automated PM Agent — end-to-end project overseer","updatedAt":"2026-02-05T09:25:50.556Z"},"type":"workitem"}

The skill must support a read-only discovery mode and a delegation mode that creates the appropriate child work-items or adds delegation comments, but it must not modify code repositories directly.\n\nUser stories:\n- As the APMA, I want the skill to answer \"what should be moved from idea -> intake_complete next?\" and return a single work-item id plus a clear plan of what needs to be done and who should do it.\n- As an engineer or agent, I want the APMA to produce unambiguous child tasks (analysis, design spec, implementation spec, tests, docs) with acceptance criteria so I can act without extra discovery work.\n- As a stakeholder, I want the APMA to delegate tasks to the right sub-agents and provide a communication trail (work-item comments and assignments) so responsibility and progress are clear.\n- As a safety officer, I want the APMA to run in read-only mode by default and never perform destructive repository actions — delegation triggers agents who are responsible for code changes under human or delegated policy approvals.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1) The skill returns a JSON structure with: `id`, `score`, `rationale`, `checks` (list of passed/failed readiness checks), `proposed_tasks` (array of child task definitions), and `action` (suggested: `recommend` | `delegate`).\n2) The skill respects filters: only search `idea` stage, allow override tag filters, and allow minimum priority threshold.\n3) The skill supports `dry_run` (discovery-only), `propose` (creates draft child work-items in wl but does not assign or change stage), and `delegate` mode (creates/assigns child tasks to named agents or agent-groups; still read-only regarding repositories). Any state changes require explicit approval or delegate policy.\n4) The skill includes unit tests mocking `wl` outputs and verifying selection, task-definition, and delegation logic.\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Implement as a Python module under `tools/skills/select_next_intake.py` with a thin CLI and a function interface for other agents to call.\n- Data access uses `wl` for authoritative state (e.g. `wl list --stage idea --json`) but provide an injectable data-source abstraction for tests and simulations.\n- Output includes: readiness checks, scoring breakdown, proposed child tasks (title, description, acceptance criteria, suggested assignee/agent, priority), and a human-readable plan summary.\n- Scoring: start simple (priority weight, has_acceptance_criteria, has_assignee, no_open_blockers); expose weights in config.\n- Logging: structured logs and a short human-readable rationale; all delegation actions must record comments on work-items describing what was delegated and to whom.\n\nSKILL.md (first draft):\n\n---\n# select-next-intake-ready-item Skill\n\nPurpose\n- Discover the next worklog item in `idea` stage that is ready to move into intake and produce a clear, actionable plan that can be delegated to sub-agents. The skill focuses on discovery, definition, and delegation — the APMA coordinates work and ensures clarity, but does not directly modify code or repos.\n\nHow it works\n- Searches worklog for items in `idea` stage.\n- Runs readiness checks and computes a score.\n- Produces a set of proposed child tasks (analysis, design spec, implementation spec, tests, docs) with acceptance criteria and suggested agent(s).\n- Returns the top candidate and either recommends next steps or delegates the proposed tasks to named agents by creating wl child work-items and adding delegation comments.\n\nUsage\n\nCommand-line\n```\n# Dry-run (default): discovery-only, returns recommendation and proposed tasks\npython -m tools.skills.select_next_intake --dry-run\n\n# Propose: create draft child work-items in wl (no stage changes)\npython -m tools.skills.select_next_intake --propose --config config.yml\n\n# Delegate: create child work-items and assign them to sub-agents (requires --approve or delegate policy)\npython -m tools.skills.select_next_intake --delegate --assign-to analysis-agent,dev-agent --approve\n```\n\nAPI (Python)\n```\nfrom tools.skills.select_next_intake import select_next\n\nresult = select_next(mode='dry_run', filters={\"min_priority\":\"medium\"})\n# result => {\n#   \"id\": \"WL-123\",\n#   \"score\": 87,\n#   \"rationale\": \"High priority, has acceptance criteria, no blockers\",\n#   \"checks\": [ {\"name\":\"has_acceptance_criteria\",\"ok\":true}, ... ],\n#   \"proposed_tasks\": [ {\"title\":\"Analysis: scope & gaps\", \"assignee\":\"analysis-agent\", ... } ],\n#   \"action\": \"recommend\"\n# }\n```\n\nResult schema\n- id: string (work-item id)\n- score: integer (0-100)\n- rationale: short human-readable string\n- checks: array of {name, ok, details}\n- proposed_tasks: array of {title, description, acceptance_criteria, suggested_assignee_or_agent, priority}\n- action: `recommend` | `propose` | `delegate`\n\nConfiguration\n- Accepts JSON/YAML config to adjust scoring weights, filters, and delegation mapping (which tags map to which agent-groups).\n- Default weights: weight(priority)=0.5, weight(acceptance)=0.2, weight(assignee)=0.2, weight(blockers)=0.1\n\nSafety model\n- Default mode is `dry_run` (read-only).\n- `--propose` creates draft child work-items in `wl` but does not change the parent stage.\n- `--delegate` assigns tasks to agents and may add delegation comments; it never performs repository pushes/merges.

Each workitem must include an array `allowed_files` (list of exact paths).\n3) Normalize: ensure paths are normalized (posix, no trailing slashes) and ignore empty entries (client-side).\n4) Grouping: run the detection module `plan.detection.group_overlaps(children)` (local code) to build a path -> [workitems] map.\n5) For each path where multiple workitems reference it:\n   a) select `blocker_id` = `plan.detection.choose_blocker(items)` (highest `sortIndex`; tie -> earliest `createdAt`).\n   b) compute `blocked_ids` = items excluding `blocker_id`.\n   c) For each `blocked_id`: perform idempotence checks using dependency records + allowed_files:\n      - call `wl dep list <blocked_id> --json` and skip if an existing dep edge points to `blocker_id` and its recorded allowed_files already cover the overlapping paths.\n      - if the dep edge does not exist, or exists but does not include the new overlapping paths, proceed to create or update the dependency record and then add comments.\n   d) If not present, record the dependency via `wl dep add <blocked_id> <blocker_id> --json` and post comments:\n      - on blocked item: `wl comment add <blocked_id> --comment \"Blocked by <blocker_id> (paths: <comma-separated paths>)\" --json`\n      - on blocker item: `wl comment add <blocker_id> --comment \"Blocking <blocked_id> (paths: <comma-separated paths>)\" --json`\n   e) Optionally: set blocked item's status to `blocked` and add tag `blocked` via `wl update <blocked_id> --status blocked --tags \"+blocked\" --json` (ensure tag merging).\n6) Consolidated reporting: after all paths processed, post a summary comment on the epic: `wl comment add <epic_id> --comment \"Plan detection summary: <details>\" --json`, but only if not already present (use `wl comment list <epic_id> --json` and client-side exact match).\n7) Idempotence: all writes (deps/comments/status) are guarded by the above checks to avoid duplicates; re-running `/plan` must be a no-op when no new overlaps exist.\n8) Error handling & permissions: failures to write deps/comments must be reported as warnings in the epic comment; partial failures should be retried or surfaced as actionable errors.\n9) Tests and CI: provide unit tests that mock the WL CLI and exercise grouping, blocker selection, and idempotence.

The focus of this request is WHAT the helper must do and WHY `/plan` needs it, not on low-level implementation details.\n\nGoals (What & Why)\n\n- Prevent duplicate informational comments (e.g. blocked/blocker/epic summary) so `/plan` can be idempotent when it posts automated comments.\n- Offer a clear, machine-oriented contract that other tools can call to ask: \"Does this work item already contain a comment with this content (or matching rule)?\"\n- Be safe: read-only behavior only — detection must never create or modify comments.\n- Be reliable across typical project sizes: callers should be able to depend on the helper for correctness even on work items with large numbers of comments.\n\nInputs (caller-provided)\n\n- Work item identifier (required).\n- Comment body to check for (required). Callers will provide the exact text they intend to post.\n- Optional scope hints (recommended): author identity, time window, or a matching mode preference (e.g. exact vs. whitespace-normalized). These are hints to narrow the search; callers must not rely on implicit normalization unless they request it.\n\nOutputs (behavioral contract)\n\n- A clear boolean indicator whether a matching comment exists.\n- When a match exists, return identifying information about the matched comment(s) (at minimum: comment id and author) so callers can reference the original instead of creating a duplicate.\n- Deterministic semantics: for a given input and matching mode the helper must consistently report the same result.\n- Error reporting: when read-permissions or transient failures prevent detection, return an explicit error state so callers can decide how to proceed.\n\nNon‑functional expectations\n\n- Read-only: the helper never creates, edits, or deletes comments.\n- Idempotence enablement: `/plan` and similar tools must be able to call the helper before attempting to post; a positive detection must be a reliable signal to skip posting.\n- Performance: the helper must remain usable on work items with many comments; callers expect reasonable latency for common cases (e.g. early-exit when a match is found) and clear error semantics for large-scale limits.\n- Auditability: the helper's responses must include enough information for callers to log or surface why a comment was not posted (e.g. matched comment id), without exposing sensitive data.\n\nAcceptance criteria (feature request)\n\n1. A documented `wl` command (or subcommand) exists that implements the read-only detection behavior described above. Documentation must specify the inputs, outputs, and error cases at a conceptual level.\n2. The helper provides a machine-readable result that indicates found/not-found and returns identifiers for any matches.\n3. Unit tests cover the core matching behaviours callers care about (exact match and at least one normalization mode) and demonstrate deterministic results.\n4. An integration test shows `/plan` can rely on the helper to avoid posting duplicate comments: run `/plan` twice against the same input and assert no duplicate comment is created.\n5. The helper gracefully reports permissions and transient errors so callers can decide to retry or surface an actionable warning.\n\nNotes / Non-prescriptive suggestions\n\n- Suggested command name (for discoverability): place the helper under the `comment` command group (e.g. `wl comment detect`), but the exact CLI surface is an implementation detail for the Worklog project.\n- Avoid hard-coding a single matching strategy: the helper should accept an explicit matching preference from callers rather than silently normalizing input by default.\n\nDeliverables\n\n- Feature implemented in `wl` with documentation describing the conceptual contract (inputs, outputs, error cases).\n- Tests (unit + integration) demonstrating correctness and that `/plan` remains idempotent when using the helper.","effort":"","githubIssueNumber":43,"githubIssueUpdatedAt":"2026-02-05T08:49:35Z","id":"SA-0ML6D6VS81S14SH7","issueType":"task","parentId":"SA-0ML63W2DD1NKSMXU","priority":"high","risk":"","sortIndex":300,"stage":"done","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Add detect_existing_comment_exact helper to wl","updatedAt":"2026-02-05T09:14:52.309Z"},"type":"workitem"}

The scheduler must ensure only one command runs at a time, respect a global maximum run-frequency limit, and prefer commands that require an available LLM only when an LLM server is reachable.\n\nUser stories:\n- As an operator, I can register commands with fields (id, command, requires_llm, frequency_minutes, priority, metadata) so the daemon knows what to run and how often.\n- As the daemon, I will run at most one command at a time and will not start any command that requires an LLM unless an LLM server is available.\n- As the scheduler, I will select the next command based on how overdue it is relative to its requested frequency, weighted by a priority, to keep actual run times close to requested frequencies.\n\nExpected behaviour:\n- New command entries can be added/removed at runtime (hot reload or via config API).\n- Each command has: unique id, executable (shell string or defined action), requires_llm (bool), frequency_minutes (positive int), priority (integer or enum), last_run timestamp (nullable), and optional max_runtime_minutes.\n- The daemon enforces a global minimum interval between any command starts (\"max every x minutes\") configurable.\n- Only a single command can run concurrently.\n- Commands that require LLM are only scheduled when an LLM server is known available. The scheduler should re-evaluate availability periodically.\n\nDependency:\n- blocked-by:SA-0ML7OB15A0HU5NKZ\n\nSuggested implementation approach:\n- Add a persistent/serialisable schedule store (file or DB) that holds command definitions and last_run times.\n- Add a scheduler component that:\n  1) Polls every configurable short interval (eg. 30s) to decide if it should start a command.\n  2) Observes the global rate limiter (do not start if last_start < now - global_min_interval).\n  3) Computes a score for each eligible command and picks the command with the highest score.\n  4) Starts the command, marks it running, updates last_run when it finishes (success or failure) and records runtime and exit code.\n- Provide an LLM-availability probe used by the scheduler to mark LLM-required commands as temporarily ineligible.\n- Expose a lightweight API or CLI to list, add, remove, and adjust scheduled commands.\n\nAlgorithm suggestions (goal: keep each command close to its requested frequency):\n- Recommended algorithm: normalized-lateness weighted scheduler\n  - For each command i, compute:\n    - desired_interval = frequency_minutes_i * 60\n    - time_since_last = now - last_run_i (if never run, treat last_run as epoch 0 or large value to prioritize initial run)\n    - lateness = time_since_last - desired_interval\n    - normalized_lateness = lateness / desired_interval  (commands with normalized_lateness>0 are overdue)\n    - priority_factor = 1 + priority_weight * (priority_value)  (tuneable mapping, e.g. priority_value 0..10 => multiplier 1..2)\n    - score = max(normalized_lateness, 0) * priority_factor\n  - Pick the command with highest score among eligible commands. This balances proportional fairness (by frequency) and priority.\n  - Add aging: if a lower-priority command never runs, its normalized_lateness grows unbounded and it eventually wins, preventing starvation.\n\n- Alternative: proportional fair scheduling using ratio r = time_since_last / desired_interval, select highest r * priority_weight. Equivalent in practice to normalized-lateness for periodic scheduling.\n\n- Notes on tuning: clamp negative lateness to 0 to avoid favouring early runs; add a small epsilon to denominators to avoid division by zero. Map priority to a multiplicative factor rather than additive to preserve relative frequency desires.\n\nAcceptance criteria (measurable):\n- A wl work item or config file schema is added describing command fields and persisted store location.\n- Scheduler implemented with: store, eligibility checks (LLM availability & global rate limiter), selection algorithm, start/stop lifecycle, and metrics emitted for runs (start, finish, duration, exit code).\n- Automated unit tests for scheduler scoring including edge cases: never-run commands, very-high-frequency commands, LLM-required when unavailable, global rate limiter.\n- Integration test or simulation demonstrating that for a set of commands with varied frequencies and priorities, observed run times are within a reasonable bound (e.g. 10-20% average deviation) of requested frequencies over a simulated period.\n- Documentation: README or code comments describing the algorithm, configuration knobs (global_min_interval, poll_interval, priority mapping), and how to add/modify commands.\n\nWhat to deliver with this item:\n- Implementation branch, tests, and documentation.\n- Suggested tuning values and rationale for priority mapping.","effort":"","githubIssueNumber":59,"githubIssueUpdatedAt":"2026-02-05T08:51:08Z","id":"SA-0ML7Q2XI11OO3S5I","issueType":"feature","parentId":"SA-0ML7NOSHP0MJC6HS","priority":"high","risk":"","sortIndex":800,"stage":"in_review","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Add command scheduling mechanism to APMA daemon","updatedAt":"2026-02-05T09:14:52.310Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Implementation must be ready to integrate with a global retry later.\n- Audit output may be large; comments must be truncated to 64k characters and include or link to an attached full-output artifact when necessary.\n - No single work item should be audited more frequently than once every 6 hours. Implementations must record a per-work-item `last_audit_at` timestamp and skip items audited within the cooldown window.\n\nExisting state\n--------------\n- Scheduler and AMPA daemon exist and already support scheduled commands, Discord webhook posting, and `wl in-progress` as a scheduled command (see `ampa/scheduler.py` and `ampa/scheduler_store.json`).\n- Related scheduler improvements and defaults have been implemented (moving heartbeat into scheduler config, switching to `wl in-progress`, plain-text webhook payloads).\n\nDesired change / Implementation notes\n-----------------------------------\n- Add a new scheduler command spec (default in `ampa/scheduler_store.json`) named `wl-triage-audit` with frequency 2 minutes and metadata indicating it performs: `wl in-progress --json` -> select least-recently-updated -> `opencode run audit <id>`.\n- Implement executor logic to:\n  1) run `wl in-progress --json` and parse result;\n  2) select the work item with the smallest `updatedAt` timestamp among those that have not been audited within the configured cooldown window (default 6 hours). If all in-progress items have been audited within the cooldown, the scheduler should skip the run.\n  3) run `opencode run audit <work-item-id>` and capture stdout/stderr and exit status;\n  4) post a short 1–3 line summary to the Discord webhook configured in `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` (include work-item id, title, and short status/exit code);\n  5) post the full audit output as a comment on the work item, truncating the comment body at 64k characters and attaching the full output as an artifact if larger.\n- Error handling: if an operation (wl in-progress, audit, discord post, wl comment) fails transiently, rely on global retry; on final failure post a WL comment with an error summary and log the failure.\n- Config options to expose: `poll_interval_minutes` (default 2), `webhook_env_var` (default AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK), `workitem_comment_truncate_chars` (default 65536), and `verbosity` (summary vs verbose).\n  - `audit_cooldown_hours` (default 6) — minimum time between audits of the same work item; implementers should persist `last_audit_at` on the item or in the scheduler store.\n\nRelated work\n------------\n- AMPA Daemon: Discord heartbeat & notifier — SA-0ML7NOSHP0MJC6HS (parent project; scheduler lives under this parent).\n- Move heartbeat to scheduler config and add wl recent command — SA-0ML8QRQXC12R12DF (moved heartbeat into scheduler; related config work).\n- Update scheduled commands to wl in-progress and wl stats — SA-0ML8VDYT303CDIWD (updated defaults to use `wl in-progress`).\n- Scheduler daemon updates and docs — SA-0ML95LRFD08CS2CZ (scheduler cwd / docs changes already applied).\n- Fix scheduler wl stats command — SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7 (related scheduler command fixes)\n- Core Heartbeat Sender — SA-0ML7OB0H20XBQO6G (discord webhook formatting and retry policies; shared code paths).\n- Implementation references: `ampa/scheduler.py`, `ampa/scheduler_schema.md`, `ampa/scheduler_store.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `skill/status/SKILL.md`.\n\nSuggested next steps\n--------------------\n1) Proceed to implement a scheduler command and executor stub (create feature branch, add tests to cover happy path and error comment path). This step involves adding the scheduler store entry, implementing selection + audit invocation, and wiring Discord/comment posting. (Recommended next step)\n2) Add integration tests that run the triage flow against a mocked `wl` and `opencode run` to verify idempotence, comment truncation and artifact attachment.\n3) After implementation, update the Worklog work item description with this intake brief and mark stage `intake_complete`.\n\nNotes / Open questions\n----------------------\n- We will use `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` as the webhook; if you want per-scheduler-entry webhooks, we can add `spec.metadata.webhook` as a fallback later.\n- The feature defers to the global retry/backoff policy (SA-0ML7OB0NX0Z9T0YV).

List concrete, low-risk next actions (create child work items, list tests to add, and propose extraction points) while preserving public scheduler interfaces.\n\nRelated work\n- Files (potentially related docs):\n  - `ampa/daemon.py` \u00021: primary daemon logic used by unit tests and scheduler calls\n  - `ampa/scheduler.py` \u00021: scheduler driver that currently imports/uses `ampa.daemon` and duplicates webhook/command payload logic\n  - `ampa/README.md` \u00021: run instructions and environment variable guidance\n  - `ampa/scheduler_schema.md` \u00021: scheduler command schema and store layout\n  - `tests/` (examples referencing daemon): `tests/test_retries.py`, `tests/test_state_behavior.py`, `tests/test_triage_audit.py`\n\n- Potentially related work items (single-line summaries):\n  - AMPA Daemon: Discord heartbeat & notifier \u00021 `SA-0ML7NOSHP0MJC6HS` \u00021: parent project for daemon/scheduler features\n  - Core Heartbeat Sender \u00021 `SA-0ML7OB0H20XBQO6G` \u00021: heartbeat sender, webhook formatting and retry logic\n  - Retry Policy & Backoff \u00021 `SA-0ML7OB0NX0Z9T0YV` \u00021: retry/backoff behaviour referenced by daemon/scheduler\n  - Scheduler: issue triage (automatic wl in-progress audits) \u00021 `SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C` \u00021: scheduler command that runs audits and posts to WL/Discord\n\nBrief summaries of related artifacts\n- `ampa/daemon.py`: implements webhook payload building and send logic; referenced directly by tests and scheduler; contains retry/dead-letter handling used in unit tests.\n- `ampa/scheduler.py`: persistent scheduler store, command selection and executor, and code paths that call into or reimplement webhook/payload sending; includes examples of scheduler commands that call `daemon` functions.\n- `ampa/scheduler_schema.md`: documents scheduler store fields and expected command metadata; helpful to preserve scheduler public contract.\n- Tests under `tests/`: exercise send_webhook and build payload behaviours via `ampa.daemon` and also run scheduler simulations; these indicate which behaviours must be preserved by any consolidation.\n- WL items: several related work items exist (IDs above) describing heartbeat, retry policy, triage, and scheduler improvements; these show the broader design intent and dependencies.\n\nSuggested next steps (first is progression required by intake process)\n1) Progress: Post this analysis summary as a Worklog comment on `SA-0MLAB9VKQ01ALR3M` and create child tasks (assign to Map) for: (a) implement the daemon-as-entrypoint change (small PR adding CLI flags and starting the scheduler from the daemon), (b) extract shared helpers into `ampa/webhook.py` (small follow-up), and (c) document test gaps. This step involves creating the WL comment and child work items and scheduling the 3-day analysis window.\n2) If approved: run a targeted review that lists overlapping functions/classes (high-level only) and produces a gated checklist of tests to add before any refactor.\n3) After the analysis: implement a small extraction PR that moves shared webhook/payload functions into `ampa/webhook.py`, keeps `ampa/daemon.py` as the runtime entrypoint and shim for compatibility, and updates scheduler imports to use the shared helpers while preserving its CLI.\n\nOpen questions for the author/user\n- Do you want the analysis to include annotated code snippets (line-level) or only high-level descriptions? (Current preference: high-level only)\n- Confirm we must not alter scheduler public CLI/APIs during refactor (affirmed).\n- Do you want a separate child task created specifically to run automated semantic diffs (e.g., using a tool) or should the manual analysis suffice?\n\nTimeline & priority\n- Priority: `critical` (unchanged).

Complexity is inferred using a text heuristic weighted by number of affected files and number of related work items (files have higher weight).\n- Notification is webhook-only (no WL mutation). The scheduler avoids duplicate notifications by checking for an existing suggestion comment on the work item and skipping if present.\n\nConstraints\n-----------\n- Delivery uses the existing Discord webhook env var `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` (no secrets in code).\n- Poll cadence default: every 2 minutes (configurable).\n- Complexity detection must be conservative and explainable; use: priority override (high/critical → complex) and otherwise a text heuristic that includes affected-files count + related-items count.\n- Eligible agents: Map and Patch (routing mapping: Intake → Map; Plan → Map; Implement → Patch). When checking for blocking in-progress items, only assignments to the eligible agent set count.\n- Idempotence: before sending a notification check work item comments for a prior suggestion (exact-match detection) and skip if found.\n\nExisting state\n--------------\n- Worklog item created for this intake: `SA-0MLAJV8J30E7G3RM` (Scheduler: select-and-assign-next-wl-item (intake delegator)).\n- Related scheduler work exists in repo: `SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C` (Scheduler: issue triage) and AMPA daemon items (heartbeat/notifier) which show existing patterns for webhook delivery and scheduling cadence.\n- A design artifact/skill exists for selecting next intake-ready items: `SA-0ML5E7ZHH0Y5VJQE` (select-next-intake-ready-item) which may overlap or be a consumer of this scheduler.\n\nDesired change\n--------------\n- Implement a lightweight scheduler process that:\n  1) Runs every 2 minutes; 2) calls `wl in-progress --json` and inspects assignments filtered to the eligible agent set; if any found, exit no-op.\n  2) If none found, call `wl next --json` to locate the next ready work item; fetch work item metadata (`wl show <id> --json`) including stage, priority, tags, related children, and any affected-files metadata if present.\n  3) Compute complexity using: priority override + text heuristic that counts affected files and related items (files weighted higher). If insufficient metadata is present, fallback to conservative path: request intake (i.e., treat as complex).\n  4) Choose target agent using mapping: Intake→Map, Plan→Map, Implement→Patch.\n  5) Compose and POST a plain-text message to `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` with the recommended instruction and agent.\n  6) Before posting, verify no existing suggestion comment exists on the work item (use comment detect helper if available) to ensure idempotence.\n\nRelated work\n------------\n- Scheduler: issue triage — `SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C`: existing scheduler that audits in-progress items and posts to Discord; use as implementation reference for polling, webhook posting, and comment posting patterns.\n- AMPA Daemon: Discord heartbeat & notifier — `SA-0ML7NOSHP0MJC6HS`: reference for webhook usage and containerization/run guidance.\n- select-next-intake-ready-item — `SA-0ML5E7ZHH0Y5VJQE`: related skill that discovers next intake-ready items; consider integration or reuse.\n- owner_inference / owner-detection skills — `SA-0MKZVABOH1I8OLXA`: possible enhancement for more advanced agent selection later.\n\nSuggested next steps (first is progression required by intake process)\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n1) Approve this draft so the five intake review passes can run; after reviews we will update `SA-0MLAJV8J30E7G3RM` with the final brief and mark stage `intake_complete`.\n2) Implement a minimal PoC scheduler (script or small service) that runs the selection logic without mutating WL, posts to `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK`, and respects idempotence checks; add unit tests.\n3) Iterate: add better complexity signals (affected_files field, related-items count) and integrate with `owner_inference` if needed.\n\nFile generated by intake: .opencode/tmp/intake-draft-Scheduler-select-and-assign-SA-0MLAJV8J30E7G3RM.md","effort":"","id":"SA-0MLAJV8J30E7G3RM","issueType":"epic","parentId":"SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR","priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":2700,"stage":"prd_complete","status":"open","tags":[],"title":"Scheduler: select-and-assign-next-wl-item (intake delegator)","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T11:00:11.786Z"},"type":"workitem"}

If related items are present it should proceed as today. If not, the implement skill must call a new skill (name suggestion: 'intake_or_find_related') that will decide whether an intake is required or whether there is enough information to search for related items and perform that search.\n\nUser story:\nAs an agent using the 'implement' skill I want the skill to automatically ensure a work item has related items (or run a lightweight intake) before implementation starts, so the implement flow has the necessary context and does not proceed with insufficient information.\n\nExpected behaviour:\n- When 'implement' is invoked on a work item, it checks the work item's description for mentions of related items (e.g. tags or keywords such as 'related-to:', 'discovered-from:', or explicit work item ids).\n- If related items exist, implement continues without calling the new skill.\n- If no related items are found, implement calls the new 'intake_or_find_related' skill.\n  - That skill decides if an intake is required (per intake rules); if yes, it performs the intake (creating/updating the work item to include intake details) and returns updated work item metadata.\n  - If intake is not required but not enough context exists, it proceeds to search for related items (using existing worklog queries or heuristics) and appends found related item references to the work item description.\n- After the new skill completes, implement re-checks the description for related items and proceeds if present. If still missing required context, implement should fail with a clear, testable error.\n\nSuggested implementation approach:\n1) Modify the 'implement' skill entry point to parse the work item description for related markers. Define clear patterns to match (e.g. /related-to:\\s*([A-Za-z0-9\\-_, ]+)/i and tags like discovered-from:<id>).\n2) If none found, call a new skill module 'intake_or_find_related' that exposes a simple interface: input: work-item-id (and optionally current description); output: {intakePerformed: boolean, relatedFound: boolean, updatedDescription: string, addedRelatedIds: [ids]}.\n3) Implement acceptance logic: if intakePerformed then re-evaluate; if relatedFound append to description and continue; else return a controlled error.\n4) Add unit tests for both skills and an integration test that simulates the implement flow when a work item has/doesn't have related items.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- A new work item is created for this change and references to modified files are listed in task comments when work is done.\n- The 'implement' skill checks for related items in the description and calls the new 'intake_or_find_related' skill only when none are present.\n- The new 'intake_or_find_related' skill exists and either performs an intake (creating/updating intake details) or searches for related items and updates the work item description.\n- Tests: unit tests covering parsing logic, new skill decision branches; an integration/unit test demonstrating the full flow where implement calls the new skill and proceeds when related items are added.\n- No existing behaviour is broken for cases where related items already exist.\n\nFiles/areas likely affected:\n- skill/implement (implementation code)\n- new skill file: skill/intake_or_find_related (or similar path)\n- tests/ (add tests for parsing/decision/integration)\n- worklog usage in skills that query/search work items\n\nNotes & risks:\n- Careful with parsing false positives — keep matching conservative.\n- Ensure the new skill respects rate limits / side effects when creating items.\n- Keep changes backwards compatible.\n\nNext steps:\n- Assign to an implementer to create branch, implement changes and add tests.\n\nAcceptance tests (minimal):\n1) Work item A has a description containing 'related-to: WL-123' -> run implement -> implement proceeds and does not call the new skill.\n2) Work item B has no related items -> run implement -> implement calls new skill which performs a search and appends 'related-to: WL-321' -> implement proceeds.\n3) Work item C has no related items and intake is required -> new skill performs intake (updates description with intake summary) and returns; implement proceeds only when intake rules satisfied.","effort":"","id":"SA-0MLBZ4ZU7018UC6U","issueType":"feature","parentId":null,"priority":"high","risk":"","sortIndex":3600,"stage":"","status":"open","tags":[],"title":"implement: check for related items before running - create intake/search skill","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T07:09:46.735Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Consider committing or stashing local changes before changing branches or running CI.\n- Work item snapshot: `SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR` — Title: Automated PM Agent — end-to-end project overseer; Priority: `high`; Stage: `prd_complete`; Created: `2026-02-02T16:33:11Z`; Updated: `2026-02-05T08:53:07Z`; PRD added at `docs/prd/PRD_Automated_PM_Agent_-_end-to-end_project_overseer_(SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR).md`.\n- Recent activity / comments: single comment by `@OpenCode` noting the PRD location (`docs/prd/PRD_Automated_PM_Agent_-_end-to-end_project_overseer_(SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR).md`) (2026-02-02T23:28:08Z).\n- Key children (priority order / status):\n  - `SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C` — Scheduler: issue triage (in_progress, priority: high, assignee: Patch, stage: in_progress) — implements automatic auditing of `wl in-progress` items and running `opencode run audit`.\n  - `SA-0ML7NOSHP0MJC6HS` — AMPA Daemon: Discord heartbeat & notifier (open, stage: prd_complete, assignee: Map) — parent for daemon-related tasks.\n  - `SA-0ML7OB0H20XBQO6G` — Core Heartbeat Sender (completed → in_review) — core sender is implemented and awaiting review/merge.\n  - `SA-0ML7OB0NX0Z9T0YV`, `SA-0ML7OB0U70BVLHF7`, `SA-0ML7OB0ZR0W3CEVA`, `SA-0ML7OB1AR1IMJVFF`, `SA-0ML7OB1H71YWK6OG` — Retry, Dead-letter, Observability, Tests/CI, Docs — mostly `blocked` or `idea` stage (these are required for robustness and full deliverable acceptance).\n- Can this epic be closed now? No. Reasons: at least one important child is actively in_progress (`SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C`) and multiple child tasks remain blocked or in idea stage (retry/backoff, dead-letter, observability, tests, docs). The epic's acceptance criteria require those deliverables and a working, tested daemon/scheduler flow.\n\nNext steps (choose one and execute):\n\n1. Finish the scheduler triage feature (`SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C`) — owner: Patch — complete implementation, add unit/integration tests, post audit output to WL comments, and move that child to `in_review`/`completed`. Recommended: create a branch `wl-SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-triage` and ensure local changes in `ampa/scheduler.py` are committed before running tests or building.\n2. Unblock core robustness tasks: implement retry/backoff and dead-letter handling (`SA-0ML7OB0NX0Z9T0YV`, `SA-0ML7OB0U70BVLHF7`) and add observability (`SA-0ML7OB0ZR0W3CEVA`). Assign owners, add short acceptance-test PRs, and land them so the daemon has retry + failure-handling before wide use.\n3. Merge PRD → operationalize: once the above children are in review/completed, update the epic with links to implementation PRs, run the acceptance tests listed in the PRD, then mark the epic ready to move (update stage and add a short closure comment with links to commits/PRs).\n\nFree-form: I can (a) generate a concise checklist and how-to for finishing `SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C` (tests to add, important edge cases, suggested wl commands), (b) draft the short WL comments that should be posted after a successful triage run (summary + artifact attach instructions), or (c) prepare a small PR checklist for the daemon (retry, dead-letter, metrics, README) — tell me which and I’ll produce it.\n\u001b[0m\n> build · gpt-5-mini\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m→ \u001b[0mSkill \"status\"\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mgit status --porcelain --untracked-files=all && git branch --show-current && wl show SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR --children --comments --json\nM ampa/scheduler.py\n?? scheduler-run.log\n?? scheduler-triage-run.log\n?? scheduler-triage-run2.log\n?? scheduler-triage-run3.log\n?? wl-comment-list-SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR.json\n?? wl-comment-list-SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C.json\n?? wl-in-progress.json\nfeature/SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-wl-triage-audit\nerror: unknown option '--comments'\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mwl show SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR --children --json && wl comment list SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR --json\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"workItem\": {\n    \"id\": \"SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR\",\n    \"title\": \"Automated PM Agent — end-to-end project overseer\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary:\\nDesign, define, and build an Automated PM Agent (APMA) that acts as a discovery, definition, and delegation engine to coordinate delivery across human and automated sub-agents. The APMA's responsibility is to ensure clarity of plan, break down work into actionable tasks, assign or delegate those tasks, and monitor progress — it does not implement code changes or directly modify repositories.\\n\\nGoal / Scope:\\nThe APMA intake flow accepts briefs and performs discovery to surface candidate work, creates clear work definitions (analysis, design, implementation spec, test plan, docs), and delegates those tasks to appropriate agents or teams. It sequences and coordinates work, triggers or requests non-destructive checks (builds/tests in read-only mode), and reports status, risks, and blockers. All code or repository modifications are executed by delegated agents (people or automation) under explicit approval policies.\\n\\nUser stories:\\n- As a product lead, I want the APMA to turn a high-level brief into a clear plan with defined tasks and assignees so work can start without ambiguous follow-ups.\\n- As an engineer or sub-agent, I want the APMA to produce unambiguous child work-items (analysis, design spec, implementation spec, tests, docs) with acceptance criteria so I can execute my assigned work with minimal additional discovery.\\n- As a stakeholder, I want the APMA to delegate work to named agents, maintain an audit trail of delegation actions, and produce regular progress reports so I can monitor delivery.\\n- As a safety officer, I want the APMA to default to read-only discovery and never perform destructive repo operations without explicit separate approval.\\n\\nExpected behaviour / outcomes:\\n- The APMA discovers and ranks candidate items from `idea` stage, runs readiness checks, and returns a clear recommended plan with proposed child tasks and suggested assignees/agent-groups.\\n- The APMA can create draft child work-items or add delegation comments in `wl` to record what should be done and who should do it; it may assign tasks to agent identities but will not perform repository pushes, merges, or direct code edits.\\n- The APMA coordinates non-destructive operations (CI runs in dry-run mode, linting, static analysis) and attaches results to work-items; any mutating repository actions are delegated and require separate approvals.\\n- The APMA generates progress summaries (open/blocked items, percent complete, top risks) and maintains an auditable comment trail for decisions and delegations.\\n- The APMA can also generate new ideas for exploration (research spikes, prototypes, alternative approaches) and surface them as candidate `idea`-stage work-items for further discovery.\\n- The APMA can respond clearly about the status of any particular work-item or group of work-items, providing current stage, recent activity, assigned agents, blockers, and next recommended actions.\\n\\nAcceptance criteria:\\n1) Given a project brief, the APMA creates an epic with child work-items that define discovery tasks, analysis, design, implementation spec, testing, and documentation steps with measurable acceptance criteria in `wl`.\\n2) The APMA can produce a delegation plan for a selected work-item: a list of proposed child tasks, suggested assignee agent-groups, and the rationale for each delegation (verify: `wl show` and comments reflect proposed tasks and rationale).\\n3) The APMA provides read-only discovery by default; `propose` or `delegate` actions create draft child work-items or comments but do not modify code repositories. Any `apply` mode that triggers repository changes must be explicitly approved and executed by delegated agents.\\n4) The APMA produces human-readable progress reports and an audit trail of delegation actions attached to the relevant work-items.\\n\\nSuggested implementation approach:\\n- Phase 1 (define): Create PRD, agent responsibilities, safety/permission model, and minimal architecture (core controller + plug-in subagents for wl, delegation, reporting).\\n- Phase 2 (MVP): Implement intake parser, discovery scorer, task composer, delegation planner (creates draft child work-items and comments), and reporting module. Keep all repo-affecting steps as outputs for delegated agents.\\n- Phase 3 (operate): Integrate with sub-agents (analysis-agent, design-agent, dev-agent, test-agent), refine delegation mappings, and add audit and reporting enhancements.\\n\\nDeliverables:\\n- PRD and design doc stored in the repo describing discovery/definition/delegation model and safety policy.\\n- APMA components (service/CLI) that implement the MVP acceptance criteria above, but do not perform direct repository mutations.\\n- Tests validating `wl` creations, proposed delegations, and reporting behavior.\\n\\nNotes / constraints:\\n- APMA is non-destructive by default: repository changes are outside its remit and must be performed by delegates under separate approvals.\\n- Follow repo conventions for task naming, branch suggestions, and commit message drafts; these should be provided as outputs for delegates, not applied by APMA.\\n- Maintain clear audit logs in work-items when delegations or proposals are created.\\n\\nAcceptance test steps:\\n- Run APMA with a sample brief and verify an epic is created with well-defined child tasks: `wl show <epic-id>`.\\n- Verify the APMA produced a delegation plan and comments suggesting assignees/agent-groups for child tasks.\\n- Confirm APMA's operations did not perform any repository pushes or merges; repository-affecting steps are present as delegated outputs only.\\n- Generate the APMA progress report and confirm it lists open/blocked items, percent complete, and top risks.\\n\\nRelated: SA-0ML5E7ZHH0Y5VJQE (select-next-intake-ready-item) and other skills that focus on discovery and delegation.\",\n    \"status\": \"in_progress\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\",\n    \"sortIndex\": 200,\n    \"parentId\": null,\n    \"createdAt\": \"2026-02-02T16:33:11.048Z\",\n    \"updatedAt\": \"2026-02-05T08:53:07.968Z\",\n    \"tags\": [],\n    \"assignee\": \"\",\n    \"stage\": \"prd_complete\",\n    \"issueType\": \"epic\",\n    \"createdBy\": \"\",\n    \"deletedBy\": \"\",\n    \"deleteReason\": \"\",\n    \"risk\": \"\",\n    \"effort\": \"\",\n    \"githubIssueNumber\": 37,\n    \"githubIssueUpdatedAt\": \"2026-02-05T08:49:01Z\"\n  },\n  \"comments\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"SA-C0ML5SVWS00DW6OKT\",\n      \"workItemId\": \"SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR\",\n      \"author\": \"@OpenCode\",\n      \"comment\": \"The PRD has been created/updated at: docs/prd/PRD_Automated_PM_Agent_-_end-to-end_project_overseer_(SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR).md\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-02-02T23:28:08.113Z\",\n      \"references\": []\n    }\n  ],\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"SA-0ML5E7ZHH0Y5VJQE\",\n      \"title\": \"Skill: select-next-intake-ready-item\",\n      \"description\": \"Summary:\\nCreate a reusable \\\"select-next-intake-ready-item\\\" skill that discovers and defines the next worklog item in the `idea` stage which should be advanced to `intake_complete`, and then delegates the resulting tasks to appropriate sub-agents for execution. This skill is part of the APMA's discovery and planning toolset: it focuses on surfacing ready work, producing clear task definitions, and assigning/delegating those tasks — the APMA coordinates delivery but does not perform the implementation work itself.\\n\\nGoal:\\nProvide a deterministic, configurable function/skill that can search worklog (wl) for candidate items, run readiness checks, produce a structured task definition (including acceptance criteria and suggested subtasks), and recommend or delegate the item to one or more sub-agents (e.g., analysis-agent, design-agent, dev-agent, test-agent). The skill must support a read-only discovery mode and a delegation mode that creates the appropriate child work-items or adds delegation comments, but it must not modify code repositories directly.\\n\\nUser stories:\\n- As the APMA, I want the skill to answer \\\"what should be moved from idea -> intake_complete next?\\\" and return a single work-item id plus a clear plan of what needs to be done and who should do it.\\n- As an engineer or agent, I want the APMA to produce unambiguous child tasks (analysis, design spec, implementation spec, tests, docs) with acceptance criteria so I can act without extra discovery work.\\n- As a stakeholder, I want the APMA to delegate tasks to the right sub-agents and provide a communication trail (work-item comments and assignments) so responsibility and progress are clear.\\n- As a safety officer, I want the APMA to run in read-only mode by default and never perform destructive repository actions — delegation triggers agents who are responsible for code changes under human or delegated policy approvals.\\n\\nAcceptance criteria:\\n1) The skill returns a JSON structure with: `id`, `score`, `rationale`, `checks` (list of passed/failed readiness checks), `proposed_tasks` (array of child task definitions), and `action` (suggested: `recommend` | `delegate`).\\n2) The skill respects filters: only search `idea` stage, allow override tag filters, and allow minimum priority threshold.\\n3) The skill supports `dry_run` (discovery-only), `propose` (creates draft child work-items in wl but does not assign or change stage), and `delegate` mode (creates/assigns child tasks to named agents or agent-groups; still read-only regarding repositories). Any state changes require explicit approval or delegate policy.\\n4) The skill includes unit tests mocking `wl` outputs and verifying selection, task-definition, and delegation logic.\\n\\nImplementation notes:\\n- Implement as a Python module under `tools/skills/select_next_intake.py` with a thin CLI and a function interface for other agents to call.\\n- Data access uses `wl` for authoritative state (e.g. `wl list --stage idea --json`) but provide an injectable data-source abstraction for tests and simulations.\\n- Output includes: readiness checks, scoring breakdown, proposed child tasks (title, description, acceptance criteria, suggested assignee/agent, priority), and a human-readable plan summary.\\n- Scoring: start simple (priority weight, has_acceptance_criteria, has_assignee, no_open_blockers); expose weights in config.\\n- Logging: structured logs and a short human-readable rationale; all delegation actions must record comments on work-items describing what was delegated and to whom.\\n\\nSKILL.md (first draft):\\n\\n---\\n# select-next-intake-ready-item Skill\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Discover the next worklog item in `idea` stage that is ready to move into intake and produce a clear, actionable plan that can be delegated to sub-agents.

defines which commands run, where they run (local host vs LLM server), and when they run. The scheduler must ensure only one command runs at a time, respect a global maximum run-frequency limit, and prefer commands that require an available LLM only when an LLM server is reachable.\\n\\nUser stories:\\n- As an operator, I can register commands with fields (id, command, requires_llm, frequency_minutes, priority, metadata) so the daemon knows what to run and how often.\\n- As the daemon, I will run at most one command at a time and will not start any command that requires an LLM unless an LLM server is available.\\n- As the scheduler, I will select the next command based on how overdue it is relative to its requested frequency, weighted by a priority, to keep actual run times close to requested frequencies.\\n\\nExpected behaviour:\\n- New command entries can be added/removed at runtime (hot reload or via config API).\\n- Each command has: unique id, executable (shell string or defined action), requires_llm (bool), frequency_minutes (positive int), priority (integer or enum), last_run timestamp (nullable), and optional max_runtime_minutes.\\n- The daemon enforces a global minimum interval between any command starts (\\\"max every x minutes\\\") configurable.\\n- Only a single command can run concurrently.\\n- Commands that require LLM are only scheduled when an LLM server is known available. The scheduler should re-evaluate availability periodically.\\n\\nDependency:\\n- blocked-by:SA-0ML7OB15A0HU5NKZ\\n\\nSuggested implementation approach:\\n- Add a persistent/serialisable schedule store (file or DB) that holds command definitions and last_run times.\\n- Add a scheduler component that:\\n  1) Polls every configurable short interval (eg. 30s) to decide if it should start a command.\\n  2) Observes the global rate limiter (do not start if last_start < now - global_min_interval).\\n  3) Computes a score for each eligible command and picks the command with the highest score.\\n  4) Starts the command, marks it running, updates last_run when it finishes (success or failure) and records runtime and exit code.\\n- Provide an LLM-availability probe used by the scheduler to mark LLM-required commands as temporarily ineligible.\\n- Expose a lightweight API or CLI to list, add, remove, and adjust scheduled commands.\\n\\nAlgorithm suggestions (goal: keep each command close to its requested frequency):\\n- Recommended algorithm: normalized-lateness weighted scheduler\\n  - For each command i, compute:\\n    - desired_interval = frequency_minutes_i * 60\\n    - time_since_last = now - last_run_i (if never run, treat last_run as epoch 0 or large value to prioritize initial run)\\n    - lateness = time_since_last - desired_interval\\n    - normalized_lateness = lateness / desired_interval  (commands with normalized_lateness>0 are overdue)\\n    - priority_factor = 1 + priority_weight * (priority_value)  (tuneable mapping, e.g. priority_value 0..10 => multiplier 1..2)\\n    - score = max(normalized_lateness, 0) * priority_factor\\n  - Pick the command with highest score among eligible commands. This balances proportional fairness (by frequency) and priority.\\n  - Add aging: if a lower-priority command never runs, its normalized_lateness grows unbounded and it eventually wins, preventing starvation.\\n\\n- Alternative: proportional fair scheduling using ratio r = time_since_last / desired_interval, select highest r * priority_weight. Equivalent in practice to normalized-lateness for periodic scheduling.\\n\\n- Notes on tuning: clamp negative lateness to 0 to avoid favouring early runs; add a small epsilon to denominators to avoid division by zero. Map priority to a multiplicative factor rather than additive to preserve relative frequency desires.\\n\\nAcceptance criteria (measurable):\\n- A wl work item or config file schema is added describing command fields and persisted store location.\\n- Scheduler implemented with: store, eligibility checks (LLM availability & global rate limiter), selection algorithm, start/stop lifecycle, and metrics emitted for runs (start, finish, duration, exit code).\\n- Automated unit tests for scheduler scoring including edge cases: never-run commands, very-high-frequency commands, LLM-required when unavailable, global rate limiter.\\n- Integration test or simulation demonstrating that for a set of commands with varied frequencies and priorities, observed run times are within a reasonable bound (e.g. 10-20% average deviation) of requested frequencies over a simulated period.\\n- Documentation: README or code comments describing the algorithm, configuration knobs (global_min_interval, poll_interval, priority mapping), and how to add/modify commands.\\n\\nWhat to deliver with this item:\\n- Implementation branch, tests, and documentation.\\n- Suggested tuning values and rationale for priority mapping.\",\n      \"status\": \"completed\",\n      \"priority\": \"high\",\n      \"sortIndex\": 800,\n      \"parentId\": \"SA-0ML7NOSHP0MJC6HS\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-02-04T07:45:09.146Z\",\n      \"updatedAt\": \"2026-02-05T08:53:07.968Z\",\n      \"tags\": [],\n      \"assignee\": \"@AGENT\",\n      \"stage\": \"in_review\",\n      \"issueType\": \"feature\",\n      \"createdBy\": \"\",\n      \"deletedBy\": \"\",\n      \"deleteReason\": \"\",\n      \"risk\": \"\",\n      \"effort\": \"\",\n      \"githubIssueNumber\": 59,\n      \"githubIssueUpdatedAt\": \"2026-02-05T08:51:08Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C\",\n      \"title\": \"Scheduler: issue triage (automatic wl in-progress audits)\",\n      \"description\": \"Problem statement\\n-----------------\\nThe scheduler must automatically triage in-progress Worklog items: every 2 minutes fetch `wl in-progress --json`, pick the item with the oldest `updatedAt` (least recently updated), run `opencode run audit <work-item-id>` against it, deliver a short summary to the configured Discord webhook, and post the full audit (truncated if necessary) as a comment on the work item.\\n\\nUsers\\n-----\\n- Operators and PMs who rely on timely visibility into stalled or neglected in-progress work items.\\n- The APMA / AMPA automation that needs regular audits surfaced to Slack/Discord and Worklog for human review.\\n\\nExample user stories\\n- As an operator, I want the scheduler to alert the team when an in-progress item has not been updated for a long time, so I can reassign or unblock it.\\n- As an APMA integrator, I want automated audits posted to work items so humans have evidence of health checks and suggested next steps.\\n\\nSuccess criteria\\n----------------\\n- Scheduler runs every 2 minutes and executes the triage flow end-to-end (fetch -> select -> audit -> deliver) with measurable logs.\\n- For each run: a short (1–3 line) summary is posted to Discord (via `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK`) and a concise summary comment is posted on the audited WL work item.\\n- Full audit output is attached to the work item as a comment (up to 64k chars); if longer, the comment references an attached artifact containing the full output.\\n- The system handles transient failures by relying on the global retry/backoff policy (no local retry logic implemented in this feature); any final failure is recorded as an error comment on the work item.\\n\\nConstraints\\n-----------\\n- Use the global `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` environment variable for Discord delivery; do not embed webhook secrets in code or comments.\\n- Poll interval is configurable but defaults to every 2 minutes for this feature.\\n- No local retry logic will be implemented here; the feature defers to the global retry/backoff work (see SA-0ML7OB0NX0Z9T0YV). Implementation must be ready to integrate with a global retry later.\\n- Audit output may be large; comments must be truncated to 64k characters and include or link to an attached full-output artifact when necessary.\\n - No single work item should be audited more frequently than once every 6 hours. Implementations must record a per-work-item `last_audit_at` timestamp and skip items audited within the cooldown window.\\n\\nExisting state\\n--------------\\n- Scheduler and AMPA daemon exist and already support scheduled commands, Discord webhook posting, and `wl in-progress` as a scheduled command (see `ampa/scheduler.py` and `ampa/scheduler_store.json`).\\n- Related scheduler improvements and defaults have been implemented (moving heartbeat into scheduler config, switching to `wl in-progress`, plain-text webhook payloads).\\n\\nDesired change / Implementation notes\\n-----------------------------------\\n- Add a new scheduler command spec (default in `ampa/scheduler_store.json`) named `wl-triage-audit` with frequency 2 minutes and metadata indicating it performs: `wl in-progress --json` -> select least-recently-updated -> `opencode run audit <id>`.\\n- Implement executor logic to:\\n  1) run `wl in-progress --json` and parse result;\\n  2) select the work item with the smallest `updatedAt` timestamp among those that have not been audited within the configured cooldown window (default 6 hours). If all in-progress items have been audited within the cooldown, the scheduler should skip the run.\\n  3) run `opencode run audit <work-item-id>` and capture stdout/stderr and exit status;\\n  4) post a short 1–3 line summary to the Discord webhook configured in `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` (include work-item id, title, and short status/exit code);\\n  5) post the full audit output as a comment on the work item, truncating the comment body at 64k characters and attaching the full output as an artifact if larger.\\n- Error handling: if an operation (wl in-progress, audit, discord post, wl comment) fails transiently, rely on global retry; on final failure post a WL comment with an error summary and log the failure.\\n- Config options to expose: `poll_interval_minutes` (default 2), `webhook_env_var` (default AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK), `workitem_comment_truncate_chars` (default 65536), and `verbosity` (summary vs verbose).\\n  - `audit_cooldown_hours` (default 6) — minimum time between audits of the same work item; implementers should persist `last_audit_at` on the item or in the scheduler store.\\n\\nRelated work\\n------------\\n- AMPA Daemon: Discord heartbeat & notifier — SA-0ML7NOSHP0MJC6HS (parent project; scheduler lives under this parent).\\n- Move heartbeat to scheduler config and add wl recent command — SA-0ML8QRQXC12R12DF (moved heartbeat into scheduler; related config work).\\n- Update scheduled commands to wl in-progress and wl stats — SA-0ML8VDYT303CDIWD (updated defaults to use `wl in-progress`).\\n- Scheduler daemon updates and docs — SA-0ML95LRFD08CS2CZ (scheduler cwd / docs changes already applied).\\n- Fix scheduler wl stats command — SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7 (related scheduler command fixes)\\n- Core Heartbeat Sender — SA-0ML7OB0H20XBQO6G (discord webhook formatting and retry policies; shared code paths).\\n- Implementation references: `ampa/scheduler.py`, `ampa/scheduler_schema.md`, `ampa/scheduler_store.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `skill/status/SKILL.md`.\\n\\nSuggested next steps\\n--------------------\\n1) Proceed to implement a scheduler command and executor stub (create feature branch, add tests to cover happy path and error comment path). This step involves adding the scheduler store entry, implementing selection + audit invocation, and wiring Discord/comment posting. (Recommended next step)\\n2) Add integration tests that run the triage flow against a mocked `wl` and `opencode run` to verify idempotence, comment truncation and artifact attachment.\\n3) After implementation, update the Worklog work item description with this intake brief and mark stage `intake_complete`.\\n\\nNotes / Open questions\\n----------------------\\n- We will use `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` as the webhook; if you want per-scheduler-entry webhooks, we can add `spec.metadata.webhook` as a fallback later.\\n- The feature defers to the global retry/backoff policy (SA-0ML7OB0NX0Z9T0YV).

{"data":{"author":"ampa-scheduler","comment":"# AMPA Audit Result\n\nAudit output:\n\n**Audit: SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR**\n\n- Snapshot: `Automated PM Agent — end-to-end project overseer` — status: `in_progress`, stage: `prd_complete`, priority: `high`; cannot be closed because several child work-items remain in-progress or blocked.\n- Repo / local state: current branch `feature/SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-wl-triage-audit`; there is an unstaged modification `ampa/scheduler.py` and untracked artifacts (`scheduler-run.log`, `wl-comment-list-SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR.json`, etc.). Commit or stash these before switching branches or running CI.\n- PRD & audit trail: PRD present at `docs/prd/PRD_Automated_PM_Agent_-_end-to-end_project_overseer_(SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR).md`; recent audit comment generated by `ampa-scheduler` (2026-02-05T09:14:52Z) and a PRD note by `@OpenCode` (2026-02-02T23:28:08Z).\n- Key children (short): \n  - `SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C` — Scheduler: issue triage — status: `in_progress`, priority: `high`, assignee: `Patch` — primary automation that runs audits.\n  - `SA-0ML7NOSHP0MJC6HS` — AMPA Daemon (Discord heartbeat & notifier) — status: `open`, stage: `prd_complete`, assignee: `Map` — has many blocked subtasks.\n  - `SA-0ML7OB0H20XBQO6G` — Core Heartbeat Sender — status: `completed` → `in_review` (awaiting merge/review).\n  - Blocked/idea children under the daemon: `SA-0ML7OB0NX0Z9T0YV` (Retry), `SA-0ML7OB0U70BVLHF7` (Dead-letter), `SA-0ML7OB0ZR0W3CEVA` (Observability), `SA-0ML7OB1AR1IMJVFF` (Tests/CI), `SA-0ML7OB1H71YWK6OG` (Docs) — many are `blocked` or `idea` and prevent safe delivery of the daemon.\n- Can this epic be closed? No — closure requires finishing the in-progress scheduler work (`SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C`) and unblocking/completing the daemon’s blocked children (retry/backoff, dead-letter, observability, tests/CI, docs), and ensuring review/merge of in-review items.\n\nNext steps (ordered, actionable)\n1. Finish the scheduler triage feature: resolve remaining work on `SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C` (assignee `Patch`), run the end-to-end triage (fetch -> select -> audit -> post), merge the in-review PRs, and confirm automated audit comments are posted to audited work-items. (Recommended: run `opencode run audit SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C` to validate the flow.)\n2. Unblock and complete AMPA Daemon deliverables: merge the Core Heartbeat Sender (`SA-0ML7OB0H20XBQO6G`), then implement/merge Retry (`SA-0ML7OB0NX0Z9T0YV`), Dead-letter (`SA-0ML7OB0U70BVLHF7`), Observability (`SA-0ML7OB0ZR0W3CEVA`), Tests/CI (`SA-0ML7OB1AR1IMJVFF`), and Docs (`SA-0ML7OB1H71YWK6OG`). Completing those will remove the majority of blockers for the epic.\n3. Clean workspace and attach full audit: commit or stash local changes (`git add ampa/scheduler.py && git commit -m \"WIP: save scheduler changes\"` or `git stash`), then add the full audit output as a comment or artifact on `SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR` (use `wl comment add SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR --comment \"<summary and link to artifact>\"` or attach `wl-comment-list-SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR.json`) so the audit is preserved with the epic.\n\nIf you want, I can run the scheduler triage audit now for `SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C` and post the results to the work item (it will also produce a concise Discord summary if `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` is configured).

The APMA's responsibility is to ensure clarity of plan, break down work into actionable tasks, assign or delegate those tasks, and monitor progress — it does not implement code changes or directly modify repositories.\\n\\nGoal / Scope:\\nThe APMA intake flow accepts briefs and performs discovery to surface candidate work, creates clear work definitions (analysis, design, implementation spec, test plan, docs), and delegates those tasks to appropriate agents or teams. It sequences and coordinates work, triggers or requests non-destructive checks (builds/tests in read-only mode), and reports status, risks, and blockers. All code or repository modifications are executed by delegated agents (people or automation) under explicit approval policies.\\n\\nUser stories:\\n- As a product lead, I want the APMA to turn a high-level brief into a clear plan with defined tasks and assignees so work can start without ambiguous follow-ups.\\n- As an engineer or sub-agent, I want the APMA to produce unambiguous child work-items (analysis, design spec, implementation spec, tests, docs) with acceptance criteria so I can execute my assigned work with minimal additional discovery.\\n- As a stakeholder, I want the APMA to delegate work to named agents, maintain an audit trail of delegation actions, and produce regular progress reports so I can monitor delivery.\\n- As a safety officer, I want the APMA to default to read-only discovery and never perform destructive repo operations without explicit separate approval.\\n\\nExpected behaviour / outcomes:\\n- The APMA discovers and ranks candidate items from `idea` stage, runs readiness checks, and returns a clear recommended plan with proposed child tasks and suggested assignees/agent-groups.\\n- The APMA can create draft child work-items or add delegation comments in `wl` to record what should be done and who should do it; it may assign tasks to agent identities but will not perform repository pushes, merges, or direct code edits.\\n- The APMA coordinates non-destructive operations (CI runs in dry-run mode, linting, static analysis) and attaches results to work-items; any mutating repository actions are delegated and require separate approvals.\\n- The APMA generates progress summaries (open/blocked items, percent complete, top risks) and maintains an auditable comment trail for decisions and delegations.\\n- The APMA can also generate new ideas for exploration (research spikes, prototypes, alternative approaches) and surface them as candidate `idea`-stage work-items for further discovery.\\n- The APMA can respond clearly about the status of any particular work-item or group of work-items, providing current stage, recent activity, assigned agents, blockers, and next recommended actions.\\n\\nAcceptance criteria:\\n1) Given a project brief, the APMA creates an epic with child work-items that define discovery tasks, analysis, design, implementation spec, testing, and documentation steps with measurable acceptance criteria in `wl`.\\n2) The APMA can produce a delegation plan for a selected work-item: a list of proposed child tasks, suggested assignee agent-groups, and the rationale for each delegation (verify: `wl show` and comments reflect proposed tasks and rationale).\\n3) The APMA provides read-only discovery by default; `propose` or `delegate` actions create draft child work-items or comments but do not modify code repositories. Any `apply` mode that triggers repository changes must be explicitly approved and executed by delegated agents.\\n4) The APMA produces human-readable progress reports and an audit trail of delegation actions attached to the relevant work-items.\\n\\nSuggested implementation approach:\\n- Phase 1 (define): Create PRD, agent responsibilities, safety/permission model, and minimal architecture (core controller + plug-in subagents for wl, delegation, reporting).\\n- Phase 2 (MVP): Implement intake parser, discovery scorer, task composer, delegation planner (creates draft child work-items and comments), and reporting module. Keep all repo-affecting steps as outputs for delegated agents.\\n- Phase 3 (operate): Integrate with sub-agents (analysis-agent, design-agent, dev-agent, test-agent), refine delegation mappings, and add audit and reporting enhancements.\\n\\nDeliverables:\\n- PRD and design doc stored in the repo describing discovery/definition/delegation model and safety policy.\\n- APMA components (service/CLI) that implement the MVP acceptance criteria above, but do not perform direct repository mutations.\\n- Tests validating `wl` creations, proposed delegations, and reporting behavior.\\n\\nNotes / constraints:\\n- APMA is non-destructive by default: repository changes are outside its remit and must be performed by delegates under separate approvals.\\n- Follow repo conventions for task naming, branch suggestions, and commit message drafts; these should be provided as outputs for delegates, not applied by APMA.\\n- Maintain clear audit logs in work-items when delegations or proposals are created.\\n\\nAcceptance test steps:\\n- Run APMA with a sample brief and verify an epic is created with well-defined child tasks: `wl show <epic-id>`.\\n- Verify the APMA produced a delegation plan and comments suggesting assignees/agent-groups for child tasks.\\n- Confirm APMA's operations did not perform any repository pushes or merges; repository-affecting steps are present as delegated outputs only.\\n- Generate the APMA progress report and confirm it lists open/blocked items, percent complete, and top risks.\\n\\nRelated: SA-0ML5E7ZHH0Y5VJQE (select-next-intake-ready-item) and other skills that focus on discovery and delegation.\",\n    \"status\": \"in_progress\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\",\n    \"sortIndex\": 200,\n    \"parentId\": null,\n    \"createdAt\": \"2026-02-02T16:33:11.048Z\",\n    \"updatedAt\": \"2026-02-05T09:14:52.309Z\",\n    \"tags\": [],\n    \"assignee\": \"\",\n    \"stage\": \"prd_complete\",\n    \"issueType\": \"epic\",\n    \"createdBy\": \"\",\n    \"deletedBy\": \"\",\n    \"deleteReason\": \"\",\n    \"risk\": \"\",\n    \"effort\": \"\",\n    \"githubIssueNumber\": 37,\n    \"githubIssueUpdatedAt\": \"2026-02-05T08:49:01Z\"\n  },\n  \"comments\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"SA-C0ML98Q5U60YNRTW7\",\n      \"workItemId\": \"SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR\",\n      \"author\": \"ampa-scheduler\",\n\n...86714 bytes truncated...\n\nThe tool call succeeded but the output was truncated.

Recent commit: `SA-0ML7OB0ZR0W3CEVA: Start metrics server from daemon honoring AMPA_METRICS_PORT`.\n- Files of interest: `ampa/metrics.py`, `ampa/daemon.py`, `ampa/README.md`, `tests/test_metrics_and_health.py`, `ampa/requirements.txt`.\n\n# Summary\n- Blocked? Not strictly blocked by missing code — core functionality and metrics are implemented and tests are present — but closure should wait for dependency review/merge and CI verification:\n  - Blocking dependency: `SA-0ML7OB0H20XBQO6G` (Core Heartbeat Sender) is marked completed → in_review; ensure that item is reviewed/merged so metrics behavior is covered by the canonical sender code path.\n  - Tests/CI: tests touching metrics and health exist (`tests/test_metrics_and_health.py`) — run CI / pytest to confirm they pass on main or this branch before closing.\n- Open PRs: no PR URL was discovered in the local worklog outputs; confirm whether a PR has been opened for this branch and include its URL when requesting review.\n- Can this item be closed? Not yet — acceptance criteria appear implemented in code, but the item should remain open until:\n  1) the Core Heartbeat Sender dependency is merged (or the dependency is explicitly marked satisfied), and\n  2) CI/tests run green (integration tests for `/metrics` and `/health` pass).\n- If those two points are satisfied (merge + green CI), this work item can be closed.\n\u001b[0m\n> build · gpt-5-mini\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m→ \u001b[0mSkill \"status\"\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mgit rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD && git status --porcelain --untracked-files=normal | wc -l\nfeature/SA-0ML7OB0ZR0W3CEVA-add-metrics\n0\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mwl show SA-0ML7OB0ZR0W3CEVA --comments --children --json\nerror: unknown option '--comments'\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mwl show SA-0ML7OB0ZR0W3CEVA --children --json\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"workItem\": {\n    \"id\": \"SA-0ML7OB0ZR0W3CEVA\",\n    \"title\": \"Health & Observability\",\n    \"description\": \"Short Title: Health & Observability\\n\\nSummary:\\nExpose /health and Prometheus /metrics endpoints; record counters for sent/failed heartbeats and last heartbeat timestamp.

The APMA's responsibility is to ensure clarity of plan, break down work into actionable tasks, assign or delegate those tasks, and monitor progress — it does not implement code changes or directly modify repositories.\\n\\nGoal / Scope:\\nThe APMA intake flow accepts briefs and performs discovery to surface candidate work, creates clear work definitions (analysis, design, implementation spec, test plan, docs), and delegates those tasks to appropriate agents or teams. It sequences and coordinates work, triggers or requests non-destructive checks (builds/tests in read-only mode), and reports status, risks, and blockers. All code or repository modifications are executed by delegated agents (people or automation) under explicit approval policies.\\n\\nUser stories:\\n- As a product lead, I want the APMA to turn a high-level brief into a clear plan with defined tasks and assignees so work can start without ambiguous follow-ups.\\n- As an engineer or sub-agent, I want the APMA to produce unambiguous child work-items (analysis, design spec, implementation spec, tests, docs) with acceptance criteria so I can execute my assigned work with minimal additional discovery.\\n- As a stakeholder, I want the APMA to delegate work to named agents, maintain an audit trail of delegation actions, and produce regular progress reports so I can monitor delivery.\\n- As a safety officer, I want the APMA to default to read-only discovery and never perform destructive repo operations without explicit separate approval.\\n\\nExpected behaviour / outcomes:\\n- The APMA discovers and ranks candidate items from `idea` stage, runs readiness checks, and returns a clear recommended plan with proposed child tasks and suggested assignees/agent-groups.\\n- The APMA can create draft child work-items or add delegation comments in `wl` to record what should be done and who should do it; it may assign tasks to agent identities but will not perform repository pushes, merges, or direct code edits.\\n- The APMA coordinates non-destructive operations (CI runs in dry-run mode, linting, static analysis) and attaches results to work-items; any mutating repository actions are delegated and require separate approvals.\\n- The APMA generates progress summaries (open/blocked items, percent complete, top risks) and maintains an auditable comment trail for decisions and delegations.\\n- The APMA can also generate new ideas for exploration (research spikes, prototypes, alternative approaches) and surface them as candidate `idea`-stage work-items for further discovery.\\n- The APMA can respond clearly about the status of any particular work-item or group of work-items, providing current stage, recent activity, assigned agents, blockers, and next recommended actions.\\n\\nAcceptance criteria:\\n1) Given a project brief, the APMA creates an epic with child work-items that define discovery tasks, analysis, design, implementation spec, testing, and documentation steps with measurable acceptance criteria in `wl`.\\n2) The APMA can produce a delegation plan for a selected work-item: a list of proposed child tasks, suggested assignee agent-groups, and the rationale for each delegation (verify: `wl show` and comments reflect proposed tasks and rationale).\\n3) The APMA provides read-only discovery by default; `propose` or `delegate` actions create draft child work-items or comments but do not modify code repositories. Any `apply` mode that triggers repository changes must be explicitly approved and executed by delegated agents.\\n4) The APMA produces human-readable progress reports and an audit trail of delegation actions attached to the relevant work-items.\\n\\nSuggested implementation approach:\\n- Phase 1 (define): Create PRD, agent responsibilities, safety/permission model, and minimal architecture (core controller + plug-in subagents for wl, delegation, reporting).\\n- Phase 2 (MVP): Implement intake parser, discovery scorer, task composer, delegation planner (creates draft child work-items and comments), and reporting module. Keep all repo-affecting steps as outputs for delegated agents.\\n- Phase 3 (operate): Integrate with sub-agents (analysis-agent, design-agent, dev-agent, test-agent), refine delegation mappings, and add audit and reporting enhancements.\\n\\nDeliverables:\\n- PRD and design doc stored in the repo describing discovery/definition/delegation model and safety policy.\\n- APMA components (service/CLI) that implement the MVP acceptance criteria above, but do not perform direct repository mutations.\\n- Tests validating `wl` creations, proposed delegations, and reporting behavior.\\n\\nNotes / constraints:\\n- APMA is non-destructive by default: repository changes are outside its remit and must be performed by delegates under separate approvals.\\n- Follow repo conventions for task naming, branch suggestions, and commit message drafts; these should be provided as outputs for delegates, not applied by APMA.\\n- Maintain clear audit logs in work-items when delegations or proposals are created.\\n\\nAcceptance test steps:\\n- Run APMA with a sample brief and verify an epic is created with well-defined child tasks: `wl show <epic-id>`.\\n- Verify the APMA produced a delegation plan and comments suggesting assignees/agent-groups for child tasks.\\n- Confirm APMA's operations did not perform any repository pushes or merges; repository-affecting steps are present as delegated outputs only.\\n- Generate the APMA progress report and confirm it lists open/blocked items, percent complete, and top risks.\\n\\nRelated: SA-0ML5E7ZHH0Y5VJQE (select-next-intake-ready-item) and other skills that focus on discovery and delegation.\",\n      \"status\": \"open\",\n      \"priority\": \"high\",\n      \"sortIndex\": 200,\n      \"parentId\": null,\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-02-02T16:33:11.048Z\",\n      \"updatedAt\": \"2026-02-05T09:25:50.556Z\",\n      \"tags\": [],\n      \"assignee\": \"\",\n      \"stage\": \"prd_complete\",\n      \"issueType\": \"epic\",\n      \"createdBy\": \"\",\n      \"deletedBy\": \"\",\n      \"deleteReason\": \"\",\n      \"risk\": \"\",\n      \"effort\": \"\",\n      \"githubIssueNumber\": 37,\n      \"githubIssueUpdatedAt\": \"2026-02-05T08:49:01Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m✱ \u001b[0mGrep \"prometheus_client|/metrics|ampa_heartbeat_sent_total|AMPA_METRICS_PORT|/health|ampa_last_heartbeat_timestamp_seconds\"\u001b[90m in . · 54 matches\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m✱ \u001b[0mGrep \"SA-0ML7OB0H20XBQO6G\"\u001b[90m in . · 34 matches\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m→ \u001b[0mRead ampa/metrics.py\n\u001b[0m→ \u001b[0mRead ampa/daemon.py","createdAt":"2026-02-06T09:59:37.367Z","id":"SA-C0MLAPRKBA0EXSFE2","references":[],"workItemId":"SA-0ML7OB0ZR0W3CEVA"},"type":"comment"}

The APMA's responsibility is to ensure clarity of plan, break down work into actionable tasks, assign or delegate those tasks, and monitor progress — it does not implement code changes or directly modify repositories.\\\\n\\\\nGoal / Scope:\\\\nThe APMA intake flow accepts briefs and performs discovery to surface candidate work, creates clear work definitions (analysis, design, implementation spec, test plan, docs), and delegates those tasks to appropriate agents or teams. It sequences and coordinates work, triggers or requests non-destructive checks (builds/tests in read-only mode), and reports status, risks, and blockers. All code or repository modifications are executed by delegated agents (people or automation) under explicit approval policies.\\\\n\\\\nUser stories:\\\\n- As a product lead, I want the APMA to turn a high-level brief into a clear plan with defined tasks and assignees so work can start without ambiguous follow-ups.\\\\n- As an engineer or sub-agent, I want the APMA to produce unambiguous child work-items (analysis, design spec, implementation spec, tests, docs) with acceptance criteria so I can execute my assigned work with minimal additional discovery.\\\\n- As a stakeholder, I want the APMA to delegate work to named agents, maintain an audit trail of delegation actions, and produce regular progress reports so I can monitor delivery.\\\\n- As a safety officer, I want the APMA to default to read-only discovery and never perform destructive repo operations without explicit separate approval.\\\\n\\\\nExpected behaviour / outcomes:\\\\n- The APMA discovers and ranks candidate items from `idea` stage, runs readiness checks, and returns a clear recommended plan with proposed child tasks and suggested assignees/agent-groups.\\\\n- The APMA can create draft child work-items or add delegation comments in `wl` to record what should be done and who should do it; it may assign tasks to agent identities but will not perform repository pushes, merges, or direct code edits.\\\\n- The APMA coordinates non-destructive operations (CI runs in dry-run mode, linting, static analysis) and attaches results to work-items; any mutating repository actions are delegated and require separate approvals.\\\\n- The APMA generates progress summaries (open/blocked items, percent complete, top risks) and maintains an auditable comment trail for decisions and delegations.\\\\n- The APMA can also generate new ideas for exploration (research spikes, prototypes, alternative approaches) and surface them as candidate `idea`-stage work-items for further discovery.\\\\n- The APMA can respond clearly about the status of any particular work-item or group of work-items, providing current stage, recent activity, assigned agents, blockers, and next recommended actions.\\\\n\\\\nAcceptance criteria:\\\\n1) Given a project brief, the APMA creates an epic with child work-items that define discovery tasks, analysis, design, implementation spec, testing, and documentation steps with measurable acceptance criteria in `wl`.\\\\n2) The APMA can produce a delegation plan for a selected work-item: a list of proposed child tasks, suggested assignee agent-groups, and the rationale for each delegation (verify: `wl show` and comments reflect proposed tasks and rationale).\\\\n3) The APMA provides read-only discovery by default; `propose` or `delegate` actions create draft child work-items or comments but do not modify code repositories. Any `apply` mode that triggers repository changes must be explicitly approved and executed by delegated agents.\\\\n4) The APMA produces human-readable progress reports and an audit trail of delegation actions attached to the relevant work-items.\\\\n\\\\nSuggested implementation approach:\\\\n- Phase 1 (define): Create PRD, agent responsibilities, safety/permission model, and minimal architecture (core controller + plug-in subagents for wl, delegation, reporting).\\\\n- Phase 2 (MVP): Implement intake parser, discovery scorer, task composer, delegation planner (creates draft child work-items and comments), and reporting module. Keep all repo-affecting steps as outputs for delegated agents.\\\\n- Phase 3 (operate): Integrate with sub-agents (analysis-agent, design-agent, dev-agent, test-agent), refine delegation mappings, and add audit and reporting enhancements.\\\\n\\\\nDeliverables:\\\\n- PRD and design doc stored in the repo describing discovery/definition/delegation model and safety policy.\\\\n- APMA components (service/CLI) that implement the MVP acceptance criteria above, but do not perform direct repository mutations.\\\\n- Tests validating `wl` creations, proposed delegations, and reporting behavior.\\\\n\\\\nNotes / constraints:\\\\n- APMA is non-destructive by default: repository changes are outside its remit and must be performed by delegates under separate approvals.\\\\n- Follow repo conventions for task naming, branch suggestions, and commit message drafts; these should be provided as outputs for delegates, not applied by APMA.\\\\n- Maintain clear audit logs in work-items when delegations or proposals are created.\\\\n\\\\nAcceptance test steps:\\\\n- Run APMA with a sample brief and verify an epic is created with well-defined child tasks: `wl show <epic-id>`.\\\\n- Verify the APMA produced a delegation plan and comments suggesting assignees/agent-groups for child tasks.\\\\n- Confirm APMA's operations did not perform any repository pushes or merges; repository-affecting steps are present as delegated outputs only.\\\\n- Generate the APMA progress report and confirm it lists open/blocked items, percent complete, and top risks.\\\\n\\\\nRelated: SA-0ML5E7ZHH0Y5VJQE (select-next-intake-ready-item) and other skills that focus on discovery and delegation.\\\",\\n      \\\"status\\\": \\\"open\\\",\\n      \\\"priority\\\": \\\"high\\\",\\n      \\\"sortIndex\\\": 200,\\n      \\\"parentId\\\": null,\\n      \\\"createdAt\\\": \\\"2026-02-02T16:33:11.048Z\\\",\\n      \\\"updatedAt\\\": \\\"2026-02-05T09:25:50.556Z\\\",\\n      \\\"tags\\\": [],\\n      \\\"assignee\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n      \\\"stage\\\": \\\"prd_complete\\\",\\n      \\\"issueType\\\": \\\"epic\\\",\\n      \\\"createdBy\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n      \\\"deletedBy\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n      \\\"deleteReason\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n      \\\"risk\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n      \\\"effort\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n      \\\"githubIssueNumber\\\": 37,\\n      \\\"githubIssueUpdatedAt\\\": \\\"2026-02-05T08:49:01Z\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\u001b[0m\\n\\u001b[0m✱ \\u001b[0mGrep \\\"prometheus_client|/metrics|ampa_heartbeat_sent_total|AMPA_METRICS_PORT|/health|ampa_last_heartbeat_timestamp_seconds\\\"\\u001b[90m in . · 54 matches\\u001b[0m\\n\\u001b[0m✱ \\u001b[0mGrep \\\"SA-0ML7OB0H20XBQO6G\\\"\\u001b[90m in . · 34 matches\\u001b[0m\\n\\u001b[0m→ \\u001b[0mRead ampa/metrics.py\\n\\u001b[0m→ \\u001b[0mRead ampa/daemon.py\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-02-06T09:59:37.367Z\",\n      \"references\": []\n    }\n  ],\n  \"children\": [],\n  \"ancestors\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"SA-0ML7NOSHP0MJC6HS\",\n      \"title\": \"AMPA Daemon: Discord heartbeat & notifier\",\n      \"description\": \"Problem statement\\nAMPA Daemon: a small Python-based containerized daemon that monitors LLM agent activity and notifies a Discord channel via webhook.

The APMA's responsibility is to ensure clarity of plan, break down work into actionable tasks, assign or delegate those tasks, and monitor progress — it does not implement code changes or directly modify repositories.\\\\n\\\\nGoal / Scope:\\\\nThe APMA intake flow accepts briefs and performs discovery to surface candidate work, creates clear work definitions (analysis, design, implementation spec, test plan, docs), and delegates those tasks to appropriate agents or teams. It sequences and coordinates work, triggers or requests non-destructive checks (builds/tests in read-only mode), and reports status, risks, and blockers. All code or repository modifications are executed by delegated agents (people or automation) under explicit approval policies.\\\\n\\\\nUser stories:\\\\n- As a product lead, I want the APMA to turn a high-level brief into a clear plan with defined tasks and assignees so work can start without ambiguous follow-ups.\\\\n- As an engineer or sub-agent, I want the APMA to produce unambiguous child work-items (analysis, design spec, implementation spec, tests, docs) with acceptance criteria so I can execute my assigned work with minimal additional discovery.\\\\n- As a stakeholder, I want the APMA to delegate work to named agents, maintain an audit trail of delegation actions, and produce regular progress reports so I can monitor delivery.\\\\n- As a safety officer, I want the APMA to default to read-only discovery and never perform destructive repo operations without explicit separate approval.\\\\n\\\\nExpected behaviour / outcomes:\\\\n- The APMA discovers and ranks candidate items from `idea` stage, runs readiness checks, and returns a clear recommended plan with proposed child tasks and suggested assignees/agent-groups.\\\\n- The APMA can create draft child work-items or add delegation comments in `wl` to record what should be done and who should do it; it may assign tasks to agent identities but will not perform repository pushes, merges, or direct code edits.\\\\n- The APMA coordinates non-destructive operations (CI runs in dry-run mode, linting, static analysis) and attaches results to work-items; any mutating repository actions are delegated and require separate approvals.\\\\n- The APMA generates progress summaries (open/blocked items, percent complete, top risks) and maintains an auditable comment trail for decisions and delegations.\\\\n- The APMA can also generate new ideas for exploration (research spikes, prototypes, alternative approaches) and surface them as candidate `idea`-stage work-items for further discovery.\\\\n- The APMA can respond clearly about the status of any particular work-item or group of work-items, providing current stage, recent activity, assigned agents, blockers, and next recommended actions.\\\\n\\\\nAcceptance criteria:\\\\n1) Given a project brief, the APMA creates an epic with child work-items that define discovery tasks, analysis, design, implementation spec, testing, and documentation steps with measurable acceptance criteria in `wl`.\\\\n2) The APMA can produce a delegation plan for a selected work-item: a list of proposed child tasks, suggested assignee agent-groups, and the rationale for each delegation (verify: `wl show` and comments reflect proposed tasks and rationale).\\\\n3) The APMA provides read-only discovery by default; `propose` or `delegate` actions create draft child work-items or comments but do not modify code repositories. Any `apply` mode that triggers repository changes must be explicitly approved and executed by delegated agents.\\\\n4) The APMA produces human-readable progress reports and an audit trail of delegation actions attached to the relevant work-items.\\\\n\\\\nSuggested implementation approach:\\\\n- Phase 1 (define): Create PRD, agent responsibilities, safety/permission model, and minimal architecture (core controller + plug-in subagents for wl, delegation, reporting).\\\\n- Phase 2 (MVP): Implement intake parser, discovery scorer, task composer, delegation planner (creates draft child work-items and comments), and reporting module.

Update scheduled command to a supported `wl` command, update defaults/docs, and verify the scheduled run succeeds.\n- Latest comment: \"Updated scheduler defaults to use wl status instead of wl stats (wl stats is not a supported command). Files: `ampa/scheduler_store.json`, `ampa/scheduler_schema.md`.\"\n- Files referenced / touched: `ampa/scheduler_store.json`, `ampa/scheduler_schema.md` (per comment). Current workspace shows edits/untracked files; branch: `feature/SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-wl-triage-audit` and modified files include `ampa/scheduler.py` and `skill/status/SKILL.md` (unstaged). See `git status` for details.\n- Children: none. Blockers/dependencies: none recorded.\n\nRecommended next actions\n1) Update the scheduler store to use a supported command: change the `wl-stats` entry in `ampa/scheduler_store.json` from `\"wl stats\"` to `\"wl status\"` (or create `wl-status` with `command: \"wl status\"`) and commit the change.\n2) Restart or run the scheduler locally and verify the scheduled run does not log \"unknown command\" (check scheduler logs / run the command manually with `wl status` to confirm behavior).\n3) When verified, add a comment to `SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7` summarizing verification (include log snippet), open a PR if you changed files, request review, and move the work-item to done / close it.\n\n# Summary\n1) Blocked: No — there are no open work-items listed as blockers for this item.\n2) Open PR: None discovered from local repo. I attempted to resolve the GitHub repo and fetch PR/issue info (workItem.githubIssueNumber = 67) but `gh` failed to resolve the remote repository URL (GraphQL error). If you want the PR URL, run:\n   - `git remote get-url origin` to confirm remote, then\n   - `gh issue view 67 --repo owner/repo --json url` (replace `owner/repo`).\n3) Can this item be closed now? Not yet — acceptance criteria are not verifiably met in the workspace: `ampa/scheduler_store.json` still contains the `wl-stats` command set to `\"wl stats\"` (so the change either wasn't applied here or is pending in another branch/PR). Confirm the store update, verify scheduler runs cleanly, and merge the change before closing.\n4) Current standing: The item is in review and in good standing procedurally, but it requires verification of the store/daemon change and a PR/merge to be fully complete.\n\nIf you want I can:\n1) Edit `ampa/scheduler_store.json` to change `\"wl stats\"` → `\"wl status\"` and create a patch for you to review,\n2) Run the scheduler command locally and capture logs (if you want verification),\nor\n3) Attempt to resolve the GitHub remote and look up PR/issue #67.

The store/docs were updated to use the supported `wl status` (see comment referencing `ampa/scheduler_store.json` and `ampa/scheduler_schema.md`).\n- Workspace state: current branch `feature/SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-wl-triage-audit`; modified (unstaged) files: `ampa/scheduler.py`, `skill/status/SKILL.md`; many untracked log files present. Verified `ampa/scheduler_store.json` contains the `wl-stats` entry with `\"command\": \"wl status\"`.\n- Verification missing: no PR found and no evidence the scheduler run was verified in logs. GitHub lookup failed due to remote resolution error, so there is no automatic link to PR/issue #67.\n\nNext steps (pick one and I can run it)\n\n1) Ensure and commit the store change (if not already committed): verify `ampa/scheduler_store.json` has `wl status`, then run `git add ampa/scheduler_store.json && git commit -m \"SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7: use 'wl status' for wl-stats\"` and push / open a PR.  \n2) Verify runtime behaviour: run `wl status` in the scheduler daemon start directory (or restart the scheduler) and capture a successful run/log showing no \"unknown command\" error. Attach a log snippet to the work-item comment.

Comments reference updates to `ampa/scheduler_store.json` and `ampa/scheduler_schema.md`, but the change is not verifiably merged in the repo (local state is unclear).\n- Workspace state: modified (unstaged) files `ampa/scheduler.py` and `skill/status/SKILL.md`; several untracked log files present. GitHub lookup failed (remote resolution error), so no PR URL was found for issue #67.\n- Acceptance criteria / blockers: none recorded, but acceptance requires (A) verification that the scheduled command runs without the \"unknown command\" error and (B) the change be merged via a PR. These are not yet satisfied.\n- Next actions (pick one; I recommend 1 then 2):\n  1) (Recommended) Ensure and commit the store change: verify `ampa/scheduler_store.json` uses `wl status`, then:\n     - `git add ampa/scheduler_store.json && git commit -m \"SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7: use 'wl status' for wl-stats\"`\n     - push and open a PR (`git push -u origin <branch>` then `gh pr create ...`)\n  2) Verify runtime behaviour: run `wl status` / restart the scheduler and capture logs showing no \"unknown command\" error; attach log snippet to the work-item.\n  3) Attempt to resolve the GitHub remote and look up PR/issue #67 (`git remote get-url origin` then `gh issue view 67 --repo owner/repo --json url`), so we can link the PR/issue.\nReply with the number (1/2/3) and I'll perform that action (I will default to 1 if you don't respond).\n\u001b[0m\n> build · gpt-5-mini\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mwl show SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7 --json --comments --children\nerror: unknown option '--comments'\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mwl show SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7 --children --json\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"workItem\": {\n    \"id\": \"SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7\",\n    \"title\": \"Fix scheduler wl stats command\",\n    \"description\": \"Scheduler command for wl stats fails with 'unknown command' and suggests 'status'.

{"data":{"author":"ampa-scheduler","comment":"# AMPA Audit Result\n\nAudit output:\n\n**Audit Result**\n- Work item: `SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7` — \"Fix scheduler wl stats command\" · status: `in-progress` · stage: `in_review` · assignee: `OpenCode` · updated: 2026-02-05T09:14:52Z.\n- What I checked: `wl` workitem details, git status (branch `feature/SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-wl-triage-audit`), and scheduler store file `ampa/scheduler_store.json`.\n- Key findings: the scheduler store entry `wl-stats` already uses `wl status` (see `ampa/scheduler_store.json`), but there is no verifiable run / logs showing the scheduler executed without the \"unknown command\" error and there is no open PR linked locally for issue #67 (GitHub lookup failed due to remote resolution).\n- Workspace state: unstaged edits in `ampa/scheduler.py` and `skill/status/SKILL.md` (see `git status`), plus several untracked log files.\n\nNext steps (pick one — recommended order: 2 → 1 → 3)\n1) Create a PR for the change (push branch & open PR) so the change can be reviewed and merged:\n   - Commands: `git add ampa/scheduler_store.json && git commit -m \"SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7: use 'wl status' for wl-stats\"`, then `git push -u origin <branch>` and `gh pr create --title \"Fix scheduler wl stats command\" --body \"...\"`.\n2) Verify runtime behaviour (recommended first): restart/run the scheduler or run the scheduled command manually and capture logs showing no \"unknown command\" error; attach a short log snippet to work item `SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7`. Example: run the scheduling daemon or `wl status` in the scheduler start directory and save output to a log.\n3) Resolve GitHub remote and fetch PR/issue info so the work item can link to the PR/issue:\n   - Commands: `git remote get-url origin` then `gh issue view 67 --repo owner/repo --json url` (replace `owner/repo` using the output of `git remote get-url origin`).\n\n# Summary\n- Blocked: No — no blockers recorded on the work item.\n- Open PR: None discovered locally; `gh` failed to resolve the repository (GraphQL error). Run `git remote get-url origin` to confirm remote and then `gh issue view 67 --repo owner/repo --json url` to fetch the PR/issue URL.\n- Can this item be closed now? Not yet — although `ampa/scheduler_store.json` already contains `wl status`, acceptance requires (A) verification that the scheduled command runs without the \"unknown command\" error and (B) the change merged via a PR.\n- Current standing: in_review and procedurally correct; next required actions are runtime verification and creating/merging a PR (or confirming an existing PR).\n\nIf you want me to proceed, tell me a number (1/2/3). If you don't pick, I'll assume you'd like me to run step 2 (verify runtime behaviour) first.\n\u001b[0m\n> build · gpt-5-mini\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m→ \u001b[0mSkill \"status\"\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mgit status --porcelain=2 --branch\n# branch.oid 513d5b5f43ae9a2703f3dc115fdc5ffdfb591d3e\n# branch.head feature/SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-wl-triage-audit\n1 .M N... 100644 100644 100644 7f7f5103acc53a9bafb6e5ba642e39a4ef6f7fca 7f7f5103acc53a9bafb6e5ba642e39a4ef6f7fca ampa/scheduler.py\n1 .M N... 100644 100644 100644 bb1488cb53d8912690b96365ab6a2a3383254f98 bb1488cb53d8912690b96365ab6a2a3383254f98 skill/status/SKILL.md\n? audit-SA-0MKXVC7NA0UQLDR7.log\n? command/audit.md\n? scheduler-run.log\n? scheduler-triage-run-local.log\n? scheduler-triage-run.log\n? scheduler-triage-run2.log\n? scheduler-triage-run3.log\n? scheduler-triage-verify.log\n? wl-comment-list-SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR.json\n? wl-comment-list-SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C.json\n? wl-in-progress.json\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mwl show SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7 --children --comments --json\nerror: unknown option '--comments'\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mwl show SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7 --children --json\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"workItem\": {\n    \"id\": \"SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7\",\n    \"title\": \"Fix scheduler wl stats command\",\n    \"description\": \"Scheduler command for wl stats fails with 'unknown command' and suggests 'status'.

The store/docs were updated to use the supported `wl status` (see comment referencing `ampa/scheduler_store.json` and `ampa/scheduler_schema.md`).\\\\n- Workspace state: current branch `feature/SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-wl-triage-audit`; modified (unstaged) files: `ampa/scheduler.py`, `skill/status/SKILL.md`; many untracked log files present. Verified `ampa/scheduler_store.json` contains the `wl-stats` entry with `\\\\\\\"command\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"wl status\\\\\\\"`.\\\\n- Verification missing: no PR found and no evidence the scheduler run was verified in logs. GitHub lookup failed due to remote resolution error, so there is no automatic link to PR/issue #67.\\\\n\\\\nNext steps (pick one and I can run it)\\\\n\\\\n1) Ensure and commit the store change (if not already committed): verify `ampa/scheduler_store.json` has `wl status`, then run `git add ampa/scheduler_store.json && git commit -m \\\\\\\"SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7: use 'wl status' for wl-stats\\\\\\\"` and push / open a PR.  \\\\n2) Verify runtime behaviour: run `wl status` in the scheduler daemon start directory (or restart the scheduler) and capture a successful run/log showing no \\\\\\\"unknown command\\\\\\\" error. Attach a log snippet to the work-item comment. I can run this for you if you want.  \\\\n3) Create a PR and update the work item: open a PR for the change, request review, add a verification comment to `SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7` with logs, then move the item to done once merged.\\\\n\\\\n# Summary\\\\n\\\\n- Blocked: No — no blockers recorded.  \\\\n- Open PR: None discovered locally / via `gh` (GitHub remote resolution failed). To fetch a PR URL run `git remote get-url origin` and then `gh issue view 67 --repo owner/repo --json url` (replace `owner/repo`).  \\\\n- Can this item be closed now?

The store/docs were updated to use the supported `wl status` (see comment referencing `ampa/scheduler_store.json` and `ampa/scheduler_schema.md`).\\n- Workspace state: current branch `feature/SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-wl-triage-audit`; modified (unstaged) files: `ampa/scheduler.py`, `skill/status/SKILL.md`; many untracked log files present. Verified `ampa/scheduler_store.json` contains the `wl-stats` entry with `\\\"command\\\": \\\"wl status\\\"`.\\n- Verification missing: no PR found and no evidence the scheduler run was verified in logs. GitHub lookup failed due to remote resolution error, so there is no automatic link to PR/issue #67.\\n\\nNext steps (pick one and I can run it)\\n\\n1) Ensure and commit the store change (if not already committed): verify `ampa/scheduler_store.json` has `wl status`, then run `git add ampa/scheduler_store.json && git commit -m \\\"SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7: use 'wl status' for wl-stats\\\"` and push / open a PR.  \\n2) Verify runtime behaviour: run `wl status` in the scheduler daemon start directory (or restart the scheduler) and capture a successful run/log showing no \\\"unknown command\\\" error. Attach a log snippet to the work-item comment. I can run this for you if you want.  \\n3) Create a PR and update the work item: open a PR for the change, request review, add a verification comment to `SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7` with logs, then move the item to done once merged.\\n\\n# Summary\\n\\n- Blocked: No — no blockers recorded.  \\n- Open PR: None discovered locally / via `gh` (GitHub remote resolution failed). To fetch a PR URL run `git remote get-url origin` and then `gh issue view 67 --repo owner/repo --json url` (replace `owner/repo`).  \\n- Can this item be closed now? Not yet — the store appears updated to `wl status`, but acceptance criteria require verification that the scheduled command runs without the \\\"unknown command\\\" error and that changes are merged via a PR.  \\n- Current standing: in_review and procedurally correct; next required actions are verification (run the command/scheduler) and creating/merging a PR (or confirming the change is already in a PR).\\n\\nIf you want, I can (reply with the number):  \\n1 — create a patch/commit for `ampa/scheduler_store.json` (if needed),  \\n2 — run `wl status` / restart the scheduler and capture logs for verification,  \\n3 — attempt to resolve the repo remote and look up PR/issue #67.\\n\\u001b[0m\\n> build · gpt-5-mini\\n\\u001b[0m\\n\\u001b[0m→ \\u001b[0mSkill \\\"status\\\"\\n\\u001b[0m\\n\\u001b[0m$ \\u001b[0mgit rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD && git status --porcelain && wl show SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7 --comments --json\\nfeature/SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-wl-triage-audit\\n M ampa/scheduler.py\\n M skill/status/SKILL.md\\n?? audit-SA-0MKXVC7NA0UQLDR7.log\\n?? command/audit.md\\n?? scheduler-run.log\\n?? scheduler-triage-run-local.log\\n?? scheduler-triage-run.log\\n?? scheduler-triage-run2.log\\n?? scheduler-triage-run3.log\\n?? scheduler-triage-verify.log\\n?? wl-comment-list-SA-0ML5E2A2V1YILTVR.json\\n?? wl-comment-list-SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C.json\\n?? wl-in-progress.json\\nerror: unknown option '--comments'\\n\\u001b[0m\\n\\u001b[0m$ \\u001b[0mwl show SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7 --json\\n{\\n  \\\"success\\\": true,\\n  \\\"workItem\\\": {\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7\\\",\\n    \\\"title\\\": \\\"Fix scheduler wl stats command\\\",\\n    \\\"description\\\": \\\"Scheduler command for wl stats fails with 'unknown command' and suggests 'status'.

Change required: update scheduled command to use `wl status`, update store/docs defaults, and verify runtime. Acceptance requires (A) verification logs showing the scheduler runs without the \"unknown command\" error and (B) a merged PR with the change.\n- Repo state (local): current branch `feature/SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-wl-triage-audit`; unstaged edits reported in `ampa/scheduler.py` and `skill/status/SKILL.md`; `ampa/scheduler_store.json` appears modified but not committed/PR'd; several untracked log files present (examples: `scheduler-run.log`, `scheduler-triage-run.log`, `scheduler-triage-verify.log`, `audit-SA-0MKXVC7NA0UQLDR7.log`).\n- Files referenced by the audit/comments: `ampa/scheduler_store.json`, `ampa/scheduler_schema.md`, `ampa/scheduler.py`, `skill/status/SKILL.md`.\n- Missing verification: no runtime logs captured that show the scheduler ran successfully after the change; no open PR URL was discovered locally and `gh` could not resolve the remote automatically.\n\nNext steps — pick one (recommended: 1)\n1) Verify runtime (Recommended): run the scheduled command manually or restart the scheduler to capture logs showing no \"unknown command\" error; attach the log snippet to the work item.

Comment history indicates `ampa/scheduler_store.json` and `ampa/scheduler_schema.md` were updated.\\n- Repo state: branch `feature/SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-wl-triage-audit`; git shows unstaged edits in `ampa/scheduler.py` and `skill/status/SKILL.md` and several untracked log files; `ampa/scheduler_store.json` appears updated but not committed/PR'd locally.\\n- Verification missing: no evidence (logs or merged PR) shows scheduler ran successfully without the \\\"unknown command\\\" error; `gh` could not resolve remote so no PR URL was found automatically.\\n- Files referenced: `ampa/scheduler_store.json`, `ampa/scheduler_schema.md`, `ampa/scheduler.py`, `skill/status/SKILL.md`.\\n\\nNext steps (pick one — I recommend 1)\\n1) Verify runtime (Recommended): run the scheduled command manually or restart the scheduler and capture logs showing no \\\"unknown command\\\" error; attach the log snippet to `SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7`. I can run this and upload the log for you.  \\n2) Commit & open PR: ensure `ampa/scheduler_store.json` change is committed (`git add ampa/scheduler_store.json && git commit -m \\\"SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7: use 'wl status' for wl-stats\\\"`), push branch and create a PR (`gh pr create ...`) so reviewers can merge. I can create the commit and PR if you want.  \\n3) Resolve GitHub remote and fetch issue/PR info: run `git remote get-url origin` then `gh issue view 67 --repo owner/repo --json url` to link the work item to the GitHub issue/PR.

Therefore the item cannot be closed yet.\n\n1) Implement the scheduler executor and store entry (recommended): add `wl-triage-audit` to `ampa/scheduler_store.json`, implement selection logic (run `wl in-progress --json`, pick least-recently-updated item outside cooldown, persist `last_audit_at`), invoke `opencode run audit <id>`, capture output, and truncate/attach full output when >64k chars — edit `ampa/scheduler.py` and related modules.  \n2) Add integration tests: mock `wl in-progress` and `opencode run` to verify selection, cooldown behavior, Discord webhook posting (env `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK`), WL comment posting, and comment truncation/attachment behavior.  \n3) Post implementation artifacts and update the work item: push code, add a concise comment on `SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C` summarizing what was run (include run logs/artifact links), update `stage` to `intake_complete` when ready, and link the PR/commit(s) to the work item.\n\n# Summary\n- Closeable? No — acceptance criteria are not yet met: no scheduler command entry, no executor implementation, no tests, and no WL comments/audit outputs recorded.  \n- Blockers: none recorded as external blockers; main outstanding work is implementation and tests. Parent epic `SA-0ML7NOSHP0MJC6HS` exists but is not a blocking blocker.  \n- Files referenced for implementation: `ampa/scheduler.py`, `ampa/scheduler_store.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `skill/status/SKILL.md`.  \n- Repo note: local uncommitted changes present in `ampa/scheduler.py`, `package.json`, `skill/status/SKILL.md` — ensure these are committed on a feature branch associated with this work item before opening a PR.\n\u001b[0m\n> build · gpt-5-mini\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m→ \u001b[0mSkill \"status\"\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mgit status --porcelain=2 --branch\n# branch.oid e0a89d25726ea7fbb45248b3ebdf2b0b2273c92b\n# branch.head main\n# branch.upstream origin/main\n# branch.ab +0 -0\n1 .M N... 100644 100644 100644 a437e2f151dc5700a9aa117a5b0ff42f17fdce04 a437e2f151dc5700a9aa117a5b0ff42f17fdce04 ampa/scheduler.py\n1 .M N... 100644 100644 100644 db7c50784575afc81c6b50cff233259e90ae0610 db7c50784575afc81c6b50cff233259e90ae0610 package.json\n1 .M N... 100644 100644 100644 420681220bfd18a98971e6da382fabf2c49dadb8 420681220bfd18a98971e6da382fabf2c49dadb8 skill/status/SKILL.md\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mwl show SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C --children --comments --json\nerror: unknown option '--comments'\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m$ \u001b[0mwl show SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C --children --json\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"workItem\": {\n    \"id\": \"SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C\",\n    \"title\": \"Scheduler: issue triage (automatic wl in-progress audits)\",\n    \"description\": \"Problem statement\\n-----------------\\nThe scheduler must automatically triage in-progress Worklog items: every 2 minutes fetch `wl in-progress --json`, pick the item with the oldest `updatedAt` (least recently updated), run `opencode run audit <work-item-id>` against it, deliver a short summary to the configured Discord webhook, and post the full audit (truncated if necessary) as a comment on the work item.\\n\\nUsers\\n-----\\n- Operators and PMs who rely on timely visibility into stalled or neglected in-progress work items.\\n- The APMA / AMPA automation that needs regular audits surfaced to Slack/Discord and Worklog for human review.\\n\\nExample user stories\\n- As an operator, I want the scheduler to alert the team when an in-progress item has not been updated for a long time, so I can reassign or unblock it.\\n- As an APMA integrator, I want automated audits posted to work items so humans have evidence of health checks and suggested next steps.\\n\\nSuccess criteria\\n----------------\\n- Scheduler runs every 2 minutes and executes the triage flow end-to-end (fetch -> select -> audit -> deliver) with measurable logs.\\n- For each run: a short (1–3 line) summary is posted to Discord (via `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK`) and a concise summary comment is posted on the audited WL work item.\\n- Full audit output is attached to the work item as a comment (up to 64k chars); if longer, the comment references an attached artifact containing the full output.\\n- The system handles transient failures by relying on the global retry/backoff policy (no local retry logic implemented in this feature); any final failure is recorded as an error comment on the work item.\\n\\nConstraints\\n-----------\\n- Use the global `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` environment variable for Discord delivery; do not embed webhook secrets in code or comments.\\n- Poll interval is configurable but defaults to every 2 minutes for this feature.\\n- No local retry logic will be implemented here; the feature defers to the global retry/backoff work (see SA-0ML7OB0NX0Z9T0YV). Implementation must be ready to integrate with a global retry later.\\n- Audit output may be large; comments must be truncated to 64k characters and include or link to an attached full-output artifact when necessary.\\n - No single work item should be audited more frequently than once every 6 hours. Implementations must record a per-work-item `last_audit_at` timestamp and skip items audited within the cooldown window.\\n\\nExisting state\\n--------------\\n- Scheduler and AMPA daemon exist and already support scheduled commands, Discord webhook posting, and `wl in-progress` as a scheduled command (see `ampa/scheduler.py` and `ampa/scheduler_store.json`).\\n- Related scheduler improvements and defaults have been implemented (moving heartbeat into scheduler config, switching to `wl in-progress`, plain-text webhook payloads).\\n\\nDesired change / Implementation notes\\n-----------------------------------\\n- Add a new scheduler command spec (default in `ampa/scheduler_store.json`) named `wl-triage-audit` with frequency 2 minutes and metadata indicating it performs: `wl in-progress --json` -> select least-recently-updated -> `opencode run audit <id>`.\\n- Implement executor logic to:\\n  1) run `wl in-progress --json` and parse result;\\n  2) select the work item with the smallest `updatedAt` timestamp among those that have not been audited within the configured cooldown window (default 6 hours). If all in-progress items have been audited within the cooldown, the scheduler should skip the run.\\n  3) run `opencode run audit <work-item-id>` and capture stdout/stderr and exit status;\\n  4) post a short 1–3 line summary to the Discord webhook configured in `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` (include work-item id, title, and short status/exit code);\\n  5) post the full audit output as a comment on the work item, truncating the comment body at 64k characters and attaching the full output as an artifact if larger.\\n- Error handling: if an operation (wl in-progress, audit, discord post, wl comment) fails transiently, rely on global retry; on final failure post a WL comment with an error summary and log the failure.\\n- Config options to expose: `poll_interval_minutes` (default 2), `webhook_env_var` (default AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK), `workitem_comment_truncate_chars` (default 65536), and `verbosity` (summary vs verbose).\\n  - `audit_cooldown_hours` (default 6) — minimum time between audits of the same work item; implementers should persist `last_audit_at` on the item or in the scheduler store.\\n\\nRelated work\\n------------\\n- AMPA Daemon: Discord heartbeat & notifier — SA-0ML7NOSHP0MJC6HS (parent project; scheduler lives under this parent).\\n- Move heartbeat to scheduler config and add wl recent command — SA-0ML8QRQXC12R12DF (moved heartbeat into scheduler; related config work).\\n- Update scheduled commands to wl in-progress and wl stats — SA-0ML8VDYT303CDIWD (updated defaults to use `wl in-progress`).\\n- Scheduler daemon updates and docs — SA-0ML95LRFD08CS2CZ (scheduler cwd / docs changes already applied).\\n- Fix scheduler wl stats command — SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7 (related scheduler command fixes)\\n- Core Heartbeat Sender — SA-0ML7OB0H20XBQO6G (discord webhook formatting and retry policies; shared code paths).\\n- Implementation references: `ampa/scheduler.py`, `ampa/scheduler_schema.md`, `ampa/scheduler_store.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `skill/status/SKILL.md`.\\n\\nSuggested next steps\\n--------------------\\n1) Proceed to implement a scheduler command and executor stub (create feature branch, add tests to cover happy path and error comment path). This step involves adding the scheduler store entry, implementing selection + audit invocation, and wiring Discord/comment posting. (Recommended next step)\\n2) Add integration tests that run the triage flow against a mocked `wl` and `opencode run` to verify idempotence, comment truncation and artifact attachment.\\n3) After implementation, update the Worklog work item description with this intake brief and mark stage `intake_complete`.\\n\\nNotes / Open questions\\n----------------------\\n- We will use `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` as the webhook; if you want per-scheduler-entry webhooks, we can add `spec.metadata.webhook` as a fallback later.\\n- The feature defers to the global retry/backoff policy (SA-0ML7OB0NX0Z9T0YV).

All code or repository modifications are executed by delegated agents (people or automation) under explicit approval policies.\\n\\nUser stories:\\n- As a product lead, I want the APMA to turn a high-level brief into a clear plan with defined tasks and assignees so work can start without ambiguous follow-ups.\\n- As an engineer or sub-agent, I want the APMA to produce unambiguous child work-items (analysis, design spec, implementation spec, tests, docs) with acceptance criteria so I can execute my assigned work with minimal additional discovery.\\n- As a stakeholder, I want the APMA to delegate work to named agents, maintain an audit trail of delegation actions, and produce regular progress reports so I can monitor delivery.\\n- As a safety officer, I want the APMA to default to read-only discovery and never perform destructive repo operations without explicit separate approval.\\n\\nExpected behaviour / outcomes:\\n- The APMA discovers and ranks candidate items from `idea` stage, runs readiness checks, and returns a clear recommended plan with proposed child tasks and suggested assignees/agent-groups.\\n- The APMA can create draft child work-items or add delegation comments in `wl` to record what should be done and who should do it; it may assign tasks to agent identities but will not perform repository pushes, merges, or direct code edits.\\n- The APMA coordinates non-destructive operations (CI runs in dry-run mode, linting, static analysis) and attaches results to work-items; any mutating repository actions are delegated and require separate approvals.\\n- The APMA generates progress summaries (open/blocked items, percent complete, top risks) and maintains an auditable comment trail for decisions and delegations.\\n- The APMA can also generate new ideas for exploration (research spikes, prototypes, alternative approaches) and surface them as candidate `idea`-stage work-items for further discovery.\\n- The APMA can respond clearly about the status of any particular work-item or group of work-items, providing current stage, recent activity, assigned agents, blockers, and next recommended actions.\\n\\nAcceptance criteria:\\n1) Given a project brief, the APMA creates an epic with child work-items that define discovery tasks, analysis, design, implementation spec, testing, and documentation steps with measurable acceptance criteria in `wl`.\\n2) The APMA can produce a delegation plan for a selected work-item: a list of proposed child tasks, suggested assignee agent-groups, and the rationale for each delegation (verify: `wl show` and comments reflect proposed tasks and rationale).\\n3) The APMA provides read-only discovery by default; `propose` or `delegate` actions create draft child work-items or comments but do not modify code repositories. Any `apply` mode that triggers repository changes must be explicitly approved and executed by delegated agents.\\n4) The APMA produces human-readable progress reports and an audit trail of delegation actions attached to the relevant work-items.\\n\\nSuggested implementation approach:\\n- Phase 1 (define): Create PRD, agent responsibilities, safety/permission model, and minimal architecture (core controller + plug-in subagents for wl, delegation, reporting).\\n- Phase 2 (MVP): Implement intake parser, discovery scorer, task composer, delegation planner (creates draft child work-items and comments), and reporting module. Keep all repo-affecting steps as outputs for delegated agents.\\n- Phase 3 (operate): Integrate with sub-agents (analysis-agent, design-agent, dev-agent, test-agent), refine delegation mappings, and add audit and reporting enhancements.\\n\\nDeliverables:\\n- PRD and design doc stored in the repo describing discovery/definition/delegation model and safety policy.\\n- APMA components (service/CLI) that implement the MVP acceptance criteria above, but do not perform direct repository mutations.\\n- Tests validating `wl` creations, proposed delegations, and reporting behavior.\\n\\nNotes / constraints:\\n- APMA is non-destructive by default: repository changes are outside its remit and must be performed by delegates under separate approvals.\\n- Follow repo conventions for task naming, branch suggestions, and commit message drafts; these should be provided as outputs for delegates, not applied by APMA.\\n- Maintain clear audit logs in work-items when delegations or proposals are created.\\n\\nAcceptance test steps:\\n- Run APMA with a sample brief and verify an epic is created with well-defined child tasks: `wl show <epic-id>`.\\n- Verify the APMA produced a delegation plan and comments suggesting assignees/agent-groups for child tasks.\\n- Confirm APMA's operations did not perform any repository pushes or merges; repository-affecting steps are present as delegated outputs only.\\n- Generate the APMA progress report and confirm it lists open/blocked items, percent complete, and top risks.\\n\\nRelated: SA-0ML5E7ZHH0Y5VJQE (select-next-intake-ready-item) and other skills that focus on discovery and delegation.\",\n      \"status\": \"open\",\n      \"priority\": \"high\",\n      \"sortIndex\": 200,\n      \"parentId\": null,\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-02-02T16:33:11.048Z\",\n      \"updatedAt\": \"2026-02-05T09:25:50.556Z\",\n      \"tags\": [],\n      \"assignee\": \"\",\n      \"stage\": \"prd_complete\",\n      \"issueType\": \"epic\",\n      \"createdBy\": \"\",\n      \"deletedBy\": \"\",\n      \"deleteReason\": \"\",\n      \"risk\": \"\",\n      \"effort\": \"\",\n      \"githubIssueNumber\": 37,\n      \"githubIssueUpdatedAt\": \"2026-02-05T08:49:01Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\u001b[0m","createdAt":"2026-02-05T19:34:22.948Z","id":"SA-C0ML9UUUW41NHOBR6","references":[],"workItemId":"SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C"},"type":"comment"}

On a feature branch for this work item, commit your local changes and implement the scheduler command + executor in `ampa/scheduler.py` and add the `wl-triage-audit` entry to `ampa/scheduler_store.json`. Persist per-item `last_audit_at`, enforce the `audit_cooldown_hours` (default 6), select the least-recently-updated `wl in-progress` item outside cooldown, run `opencode run audit <id>`, capture stdout/stderr and exit code, truncate comments at 65536 chars and attach full output as an artifact if larger.  \n2. Add integration tests (mock `wl in-progress` and `opencode run`) to verify selection logic, cooldown behavior, comment truncation/attachment, and Discord webhook posting (env `AMPA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK`). Include an error-path test that posts an error comment on final failure.  \n3. Push the branch and open a PR linking to `SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C`; add a concise comment on the work item summarizing what changed, include run logs/artifact links, and update the work item `stage` to `intake_complete` once PR is open and CI passes.\n\n# Summary\n- Closeable?

The APMA's responsibility is to ensure clarity of plan, break down work into actionable tasks, assign or delegate those tasks, and monitor progress — it does not implement code changes or directly modify repositories.\\\\n\\\\nGoal / Scope:\\\\nThe APMA intake flow accepts briefs and performs discovery to surface candidate work, creates clear work definitions (analysis, design, implementation spec, test plan, docs), and delegates those tasks to appropriate agents or teams. It sequences and coordinates work, triggers or requests non-destructive checks (builds/tests in read-only mode), and reports status, risks, and blockers. All code or repository modifications are executed by delegated agents (people or automation) under explicit approval policies.\\\\n\\\\nUser stories:\\\\n- As a product lead, I want the APMA to turn a high-level brief into a clear plan with defined tasks and assignees so work can start without ambiguous follow-ups.\\\\n- As an engineer or sub-agent, I want the APMA to produce unambiguous child work-items (analysis, design spec, implementation spec, tests, docs) with acceptance criteria so I can execute my assigned work with minimal additional discovery.\\\\n- As a stakeholder, I want the APMA to delegate work to named agents, maintain an audit trail of delegation actions, and produce regular progress reports so I can monitor delivery.\\\\n- As a safety officer, I want the APMA to default to read-only discovery and never perform destructive repo operations without explicit separate approval.\\\\n\\\\nExpected behaviour / outcomes:\\\\n- The APMA discovers and ranks candidate items from `idea` stage, runs readiness checks, and returns a clear recommended plan with proposed child tasks and suggested assignees/agent-groups.\\\\n- The APMA can create draft child work-items or add delegation comments in `wl` to record what should be done and who should do it; it may assign tasks to agent identities but will not perform repository pushes, merges, or direct code edits.\\\\n- The APMA coordinates non-destructive operations (CI runs in dry-run mode, linting, static analysis) and attaches results to work-items; any mutating repository actions are delegated and require separate approvals.\\\\n- The APMA generates progress summaries (open/blocked items, percent complete, top risks) and maintains an auditable comment trail for decisions and delegations.\\\\n- The APMA can also generate new ideas for exploration (research spikes, prototypes, alternative approaches) and surface them as candidate `idea`-stage work-items for further discovery.\\\\n- The APMA can respond clearly about the status of any particular work-item or group of work-items, providing current stage, recent activity, assigned agents, blockers, and next recommended actions.\\\\n\\\\nAcceptance criteria:\\\\n1) Given a project brief, the APMA creates an epic with child work-items that define discovery tasks, analysis, design, implementation spec, testing, and documentation steps with measurable acceptance criteria in `wl`.\\\\n2) The APMA can produce a delegation plan for a selected work-item: a list of proposed child tasks, suggested assignee agent-groups, and the rationale for each delegation (verify: `wl show` and comments reflect proposed tasks and rationale).\\\\n3) The APMA provides read-only discovery by default; `propose` or `delegate` actions create draft child work-items or comments but do not modify code repositories. Any `apply` mode that triggers repository changes must be explicitly approved and executed by delegated agents.\\\\n4) The APMA produces human-readable progress reports and an audit trail of delegation actions attached to the relevant work-items.\\\\n\\\\nSuggested implementation approach:\\\\n- Phase 1 (define): Create PRD, agent responsibilities, safety/permission model, and minimal architecture (core controller + plug-in subagents for wl, delegation, reporting).\\\\n- Phase 2 (MVP): Implement intake parser, discovery scorer, task composer, delegation planner (creates draft child work-items and comments), and reporting module.

Acceptance requires: scheduled command runs without the unknown-command error; docs/store defaults updated if needed; tests or manual verification provided.\n- Repo state (observed): current branch `feature/SA-0ML96LPVC19CD40C-wl-triage-audit`; unstaged/untracked files include multiple logs (examples: `scheduler-run.log`, `scheduler-triage-run.log`, `scheduler-triage-verify.log`) and other untracked artifacts; unstaged edits noted in `ampa/scheduler.py` and `skill/status/SKILL.md`; `ampa/scheduler_store.json` appears updated but not committed / no PR merged locally.\n- Audit summary from comments: automated auditor (`ampa-scheduler`) confirms root cause = using `wl stats`; recommends switching to `wl status`; lists changed files `ampa/scheduler_store.json`, `ampa/scheduler_schema.md`, `ampa/scheduler.py`, `skill/status/SKILL.md`. Verification logs and an open PR were not found.\n- Verification gap: no runtime logs showing scheduler ran successfully without the \"unknown command\" error, and no open/linked PR found for the change — so the work item cannot be closed yet.\n\nNext steps (pick one)\n1) Verify runtime (Recommended): run the scheduled command (or restart scheduler) and capture logs showing the command now succeeds; attach the log snippet to `SA-0ML8XKRV80GORAL7`.  \n2) Commit & open PR: commit intended changes (e.g. `ampa/scheduler_store.json` and related edits), push the `feature/SA-...` branch and create a PR for review/merge.  \n3) Resolve GitHub remote & link issue: run `git remote get-url origin` and use `gh` to find/create the PR/issue linkage for GitHub issue `67`.\n\n# Summary\n- Blocked: No — no blockers recorded on the work item.  \n- Open PR: None discovered locally; no PR URL found automatically.  \n- Can this be closed now? No — missing (A) verification logs showing the scheduler runs without the \"unknown command\" error and (B) a merged PR for the change. and captured output (exit=0).\\n- Posted WL comment to  with heading .\\n- Confirmed temporary comment file was removed after posting; no large artifact file was left for this run.\\n\\nLogs/artifacts created during run (repo-relative or /tmp):\\n- scheduler-triage-run2.log (detailed scheduler debug run)\\n- scheduler-triage-run-debug.log, scheduler-triage-run-local.log (other runs)\\n- /tmp contains various  from previous runs; the temp file for this run was removed.\\n\\nNext steps: re-run with  set to test Discord payloads, or add unit tests to mock / to validate selection and parsing.","createdAt":"2026-02-05T10:51:15.179Z","id":"SA-C0ML9C63XL1GL8ARC","references":[],"workItemId":"SA-0ML9C3ZGB0LH2ZWF"},"type":"comment"}
