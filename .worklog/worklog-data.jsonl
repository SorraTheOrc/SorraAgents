The skill must expose a reliable command to trigger it and must follow the exact output format and constraints below.\n\nTrigger command (suggested)\n---------------------------\nUse a single command that reliably invokes the skill. Suggested CLI command:\n\n`opencode skill run risk-and-effort-edtimator`\n\nDraft prompt (to be embedded in the skill)\n----------------------------------------\nYou are an expert engineering estimator. Your task: review the issue and produce risk and effort estimates using recognized best practices (WBS, three-point/PERT, uncertainty, assumptions, risk matrix).\n\nHard constraints:\n- You must NOT ask any follow-up questions.\n- You must NOT assume access to code, repo, logs, or stakeholders.\n- You must work ONLY with the content inside <system-reminder> (treat it as the full issue context). If details are missing, call them out explicitly and choose conservative estimates.\n\nWhat to do:\n1) Restate the issue in 1–2 sentences (to prove understanding).\n2) Identify scope boundaries:\n   - In scope\n   - Out of scope\n3) Build a lightweight work breakdown (WBS) with 5–12 items (design, implementation, tests, docs, rollout, monitoring), noting likely dependencies and unknowns.\n4) Effort estimate (use three-point estimating / PERT):\n   - Provide Optimistic (O), Most Likely (M), Pessimistic (P) in “ideal engineering days” (or hours if very small).\n   - Compute Expected (E) = (O + 4M + P) / 6.\n   - Add “coordination overhead” and “risk buffer” explicitly if warranted (don’t hide it).\n   - Provide a final range (min–max) and a single recommended planning value.\n   - Also provide a T-shirt size (XS/S/M/L/XL) with clear thresholds you define.\n5) Risk estimate (use a probability x impact matrix):\n   - Score Probability (1–5) and Impact (1–5).\n   - Overall Risk Score = Probability * Impact (1–25) and map to: Low (1–5), Medium (6–12), High (13–19), Critical (20–25).\n   - Break risk into categories with 1–2 bullets each: Technical, Product/Requirements, Delivery/Dependencies, Operational/Performance, Security/Compliance.\n   - Include top 3 risk drivers and the best mitigation for each.\n6) Confidence:\n   - Provide confidence % (0–100) with a one-line justification referencing missing info/uncertainty.\n7) If the issue is underspecified, propose a “spike” option:\n   - Spike goal, timebox, and how it would reduce uncertainty (and how estimates would change).\n\nOutput format\n-------------\n- First: a compact JSON block with keys exactly:\n  - effort: { \"unit\": \"ideal_days\", \"tshirt\": \"\", \"o\": 0, \"m\": 0, \"p\": 0, \"expected\": 0, \"recommended\": 0, \"range\": [0,0] }\n  - risk: { \"probability\": 0, \"impact\": 0, \"score\": 0, \"level\": \"\", \"top_drivers\": [], \"mitigations\": [] }\n  - confidence_percent: 0\n  - assumptions: []\n  - unknowns: []\n- Then: a brief narrative (bulleted) explaining the reasoning, WBS, and what would most change the estimates.\n\nIntegration details / constraints\n--------------------------------\n- The skill must accept an input block called <system-reminder> and must use only that content to produce estimates.\n- The skill must never ask follow-up questions; if information is missing it should explicitly list unknowns and choose conservative estimates.\n- The produced JSON must match the key names and types exactly to allow programmatic consumption.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n-------------------\n- Running `opencode skill run risk-and-effort-edtimator` with an input issue containing a <system-reminder> block returns a valid JSON block followed by the narrative.\n- JSON validates against the shape described above and numbers are realistic (non-negative, expected computed correctly).\n- The narrative includes a 5–12 item WBS and top 3 risk drivers with mitigations.\n\nSuggested next steps\n--------------------\n1. Create a GitHub issue from this file (title: \"Risk and Effort Edtimator Skill\").\n2. Add labels: `P0`, `feature`, `spec`.\n3. Assign a product owner (@product-owner) and link to this worklog file.\n4. Implement the skill (prototype using the draft prompt); expose the CLI command `opencode skill run risk-and-effort-edtimator`.\n5. Write automated tests validating JSON output shape and example estimates for 2–3 representative issues.\n\nNotes\n-----\n- This is a top-level P0 issue describing the desired new skill and the exact estimation output format required from the skill.\n- The skill must be conservative by default and must flag missing info rather than inventing it.","effort":"L","githubIssueId":3852122460,"githubIssueNumber":3,"githubIssueUpdatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:37:58Z","id":"SA-0MKSTQR3H1HLD7HC","issueType":"","parentId":"SA-0MKYVWAKU14W795Z","priority":"high","risk":"High","sortIndex":0,"stage":"in_review","status":"completed","tags":["P0","feature","spec"],"title":"Risk and Effort Estimator Skill","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T10:18:49.133Z"},"type":"workitem"}

{"data":{"assignee":"Map","createdAt":"2026-01-28T19:00:23.307Z","createdBy":"","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","description":"Problem statement\n---------------\nAgents sometimes encounter failing tests during automated work that originate in code they do not own. There is no consistent, automated process for detecting whether an existing critical work item already captures that failure, creating a critical issue when needed, and recording blocking relationships — which leads to duplicated effort, lost signal, and stalled work.\n\nUsers\n-----\n- Agents (automation) that run tests and make code changes — need a clear, predictable triage flow when they see external failures.\n- Developers/owners of failing code — get consistent, reproducible bug reports with repro steps and CI evidence.\n- PMs / on-call / triage roles — need each critical failure assigned and tracked to resolution so work capacity is not wasted.\n\nSuccess criteria\n----------------\n- When an agent detects a failing test it does NOT own, it automatically searches worklog for an existing open critical issue matching the failure. If none exists, the agent creates one (title + test name + failing output + reproduction steps + suspected owners). (Automation verified by unit/integration tests.)\n- Other work may continue locally, but the existence of any open critical work item blocks creation or merging of any PR (regardless of whether the PR's work item is explicitly recorded as blocked), except for PRs that are intended to close a critical issue and explicitly reference that critical issue ID.\n- Any created critical issue uses the agreed minimal template and is assigned or flagged for triage within X minutes (configurable). Tests validate issue content and linking behavior.\n\nConstraints\n-----------\n - Agents must have permission to create and update work items in wl and to access CI artifacts/links if available.\n- The matching heuristics must be conservative to avoid false positives; agents must not overwrite existing issue fields.\n- The policy must not block non-PR local work; blocking applies only to PR creation/merges as specified.\n\nExisting state\n--------------\n- Current work item: SA-0MKYE4BRF1U5WZLK (this intake) records the seed intent and high-level suggested implementation.\n- Implementation guidance and agent flows reference test-fix requirements in `command/implement.md` (mentions “Fix any failing tests before continuing”).\n- `AGENTS.md` documents dependency tags like `blocked-by:<work-item-id>` which this policy will use for linking.\n- Related operational items: SA-0MKYE40VG1V2DTOX (wl show --thread bug) and SA-0MKYE4G3M0B67053 (PM periodic critical-check) — both are related processes to coordinate with.\n\nDesired change\n--------------\n- Add a helper library/function in the agent toolkit, `check_or_create_critical_issue(failure_signature, evidence)` that:\n  - searches wl for matching open critical issues using default heuristics (title + test name + `test-failure` tag + recent timestamp window),\n  - if found, returns the matching issue id; if not found, creates a critical work item using the minimal template and returns the new id.\n - Update agent workflows to call the helper when detecting external failing tests and then:\n  - prevent creation/merge of PRs for any work item while any open critical issue exists, except for PRs that are intended to close a critical issue and explicitly reference that critical issue ID.\n- Add unit tests for the helper, and an integration test that simulates an agent finding a failing test and confirms the correct WL interactions (search, create, link).\n- Add a short runbook and a template for the created critical issues.\n\nMatching heuristics (default)\n----------------------------\n- Match existing critical issues using these checks (in order):\n  1. Exact test name + `test-failure` tag + open status within the last 72 hours.\n  2. Title similarity (token overlap) with test name and matching stacktrace top-frame.\n  3. CI job URL or failing commit hash matches an open critical issue.\n- If multiple candidates match, prefer the most recent open issue; if ambiguity remains, attach a comment to the most recent candidate and alert triage.\n\nCritical issue template (minimal required fields)\n-----------------------------------------------\n- Title: `[test-failure] <test-name> — <short-failure-summary>`\n- Body fields (required):\n  - Test name\n  - Failing output / short stderr snippet\n  - Reproduction steps (may be multi-step; must be sufficient for a developer to re-run the failure)\n  - Suspected owner(s) or area labels (if detectable)\n  - Failing commit hash (if available)\n  - Attach logs or link to an archive if larger than inline limits\n\nRelated work\n------------\n- `command/implement.md` — agent guidance mentioning test-fix expectations (path: `command/implement.md`).\n- `AGENTS.md` — dependency tagging and conventions (path: `AGENTS.md`).\n- SA-0MKYE40VG1V2DTOX — `Agent error: 'wl show --thread' missing when running /impplement` (operational bug to coordinate with). \n- SA-0MKYE4G3M0B67053 — `PM duty: periodic check for critical issues and immediate assignment` (process for assignment/triage).\n\nAcceptance criteria (detailed)\n-----------------------------\n1. Automated tests: unit tests for `check_or_create_critical_issue` covering match, create, and conflict resolution; one integration test that simulates an agent run creating or linking to a critical issue and marking WIP linked/updated.\n2. When an agent detects an external failing test, it automatically searches and creates a critical issue per the template if none exists. The created issue is priority `critical`, tagged `test-failure`, and includes required fields (including reproduction steps).\n3. When an agent finds an existing critical issue it should update/improve the issue description with any new information discovered from the failure. Creation or merging of any PR is blocked while any critical issue remains open, except for PRs that explicitly aim to close a critical issue and reference its id in the PR description.\n4. A short runbook and template file are added to the repo (path: `/.opencode/triage/test-failure-template.md`) describing fields and triage steps.\n\nRisks & mitigations\n--------------------\n- Risk: False positives — a matching heuristic may incorrectly match unrelated failures, causing unnecessary blocking.\n  - Mitigation: Conservative heuristics (exact test name + `test-failure` tag + 72h window) and prefer recent issues; provide an override path for humans to un-block when needed.\n- Risk: Flaky tests cause noise and frequent critical issues.\n  - Mitigation: Add optional CI re-check or a flakiness score; include flakiness flag in issues and route to a separate triage queue.\n- Risk: Agents lack permissions to read CI metadata or create issues.\n  - Mitigation: Add a startup check that verifies required permissions and fails fast with a clear error message.\n\n\n\nNotes / Open questions\n----------------------\n- Do you want the agent to re-run CI automatically (flaky-check) before creating a critical issue? Current default: no — agents create issues immediately on deterministic failures; CI re-check could be added as an enhancement. \n- Who should be the default assignee or triage role for newly-created critical issues (e.g., `@oncall`, `@pm`, or leave unassigned)? Current draft requires triage within a configurable time window but does not auto-assign a specific person by default.","effort":"","id":"SA-0MKYE4BRF1U5WZLK","issueType":"feature","parentId":"SA-0MKYVWAKU14W795Z","priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":0,"stage":"plan_complete","status":"in_progress","tags":[],"title":"Agent policy: create/check critical issue when encountering failing tests not owned","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T19:48:56.045Z"},"type":"workitem"}
