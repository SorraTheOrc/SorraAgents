Process for /plan conflict detection converted to WL CLI commands and helper work-items.

Steps (converted to wl commands):
1) Input: `epic_id`.
2) Fetch siblings: run `wl show <epic_id> --children --json` to obtain canonical workitem JSONs. Each workitem must include an array `allowed_files` (list of exact paths).
3) Normalize: ensure paths are normalized (posix, no trailing slashes) and ignore empty entries (client-side).
4) Grouping: run the detection module `plan.detection.group_overlaps(children)` (local code) to build a path -> [workitems] map.
5) For each path where multiple workitems reference it:
   a) select `blocker_id` = `plan.detection.choose_blocker(items)` (highest `sortIndex`; tie -> earliest `createdAt`).
   b) compute `blocked_ids` = items excluding `blocker_id`.
   c) For each `blocked_id`: perform idempotence checks using dependency records + allowed_files:
      - call `wl dep list <blocked_id> --json` and skip if an existing dep edge points to `blocker_id` and its recorded allowed_files already cover the overlapping paths.
      - if the dep edge does not exist, or exists but does not include the new overlapping paths, proceed to create or update the dependency record and then add comments.
   d) If not present, record the dependency via `wl dep add <blocked_id> <blocker_id> --json` and post comments:
      - on blocked item: `wl comment add <blocked_id> --comment "Blocked by <blocker_id> (paths: <comma-separated paths>)" --json`
      - on blocker item: `wl comment add <blocker_id> --comment "Blocking <blocked_id> (paths: <comma-separated paths>)" --json`
   e) Optionally: set blocked item's status to `blocked` and add tag `blocked` via `wl update <blocked_id> --status blocked --tags "+blocked" --json` (ensure tag merging).
6) Consolidated reporting: after all paths processed, post a summary comment on the epic: `wl comment add <epic_id> --comment "Plan detection summary: <details>" --json`, but only if not already present (use `wl comment list <epic_id> --json` and client-side exact match).
7) Idempotence: all writes (deps/comments/status) are guarded by the above checks to avoid duplicates; re-running `/plan` must be a no-op when no new overlaps exist.
8) Error handling & permissions: failures to write deps/comments must be reported as warnings in the epic comment; partial failures should be retried or surfaced as actionable errors.
9) Tests and CI: provide unit tests that mock the WL CLI and exercise grouping, blocker selection, and idempotence. Provide an integration test that runs `/plan` twice and asserts no duplicate deps/comments.

New helper/CLI work items created to support the conversion:
- SA-0ML6D6UJ21D9XTNU: Add dependency commands to wl CLI (dep-add/dep-list/dep-remove)

Comment formats (exact text used to detect duplicates):
- Blocked comment: `Blocked by <blocker_id> (paths: <comma-separated paths>)`
- Blocker comment: `Blocking <blocked_id> (paths: <comma-separated paths>)`
- Epic summary: `Plan detection summary: <details>`

Notes:
- Uses exact-path matching only (no globs).
- Multiple overlapping paths between the same pair should result in a single dep edge but multiple path entries in comments or a consolidated comment.
- WL CLI helper commands may be extended to support `--json` and exact-match detection convenience operations.
