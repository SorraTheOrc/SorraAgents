# Minimal Containerfile for Distrobox development containers
# - Base: debian:slim
# - Installs only minimal runtime packages Distrobox needs (bash, curl, ca-certificates)
# - Does NOT install Python, Node.js, wl, git, gh, or other developer tooling; those come
#   from the mounted home directory inside Distrobox per project conventions.
#
# Build:
#   podman build -t ampa-dev:latest ampa/
#
# Verify (example):
#   podman build -t ampa-dev:latest ampa/ && podman images | grep ampa-dev
