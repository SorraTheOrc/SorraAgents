# Minimal Containerfile for Distrobox development containers.
# Tooling (Python, Node.js, wl, git, gh, opencode) comes from the host's
# home directory, which Distrobox mounts automatically.
#
# Build:
#   podman build -t ampa-dev:latest ampa/
#
# Verify:
#   podman build -t ampa-dev:latest ampa/ && podman images | grep ampa-dev

# Install only the packages Distrobox needs to function correctly inside the
# container plus basic utilities for shell sessions.  Distrobox injects its
# own init system and expects coreutils, bash, and a few networking/system
# tools to be available.
#
# Developer toolchain (Python, Node.js, wl, git, gh) is NOT installed here;
# it comes from the mounted home directory.
