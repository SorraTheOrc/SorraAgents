- Restatement: Implement a Risk & Effort Estimator skill that ingests an issue and produces a structured PERT effort estimate and risk matrix for engineering planning.
- WBS: 1) Requirements & prompt spec; 2) CLI trigger + opencode/wl integration; 3) Core estimator logic (WBS, PERT, risk aggregation); 4) Helper scripts (calc_*); 5) Tests (unit, integration, JSON shape); 6) Documentation & examples; 7) CI/QA checks and pre-commit hooks; 8) Release packaging and CLI entrypoint; 9) Monitoring/telemetry and maintenance handoff.
- PERT (hours): O=120, M=240, P=480 → Expected E = (120 + 4*240 + 480)/6 = 1560/6 = 260.0h.
- Additive overheads: coordination 24h, review 16h, testing/integration 32h, risk buffer 24h → overhead total 96h.
- Final range and recommendation: min = O + overhead = 120+96 = 216h; max = P + overhead = 480+96 = 576h; recommended planning value ≈ 360h (rounded conservative from 356h).
- T-shirt size: XL (thresholds: XL ≥ 240h).
- Certainty for risk calculation: 65% (moderate uncertainty around integration and security constraints).
- Risk (parent & children P/I): Parent SA-0MKSTQR3H1HLD7HC P=4 I=4; Child SA-0MKT9O9AY002COU8 (TOTP synthetic) P=3 I=3; other TEST CHILDs P=1 I=1.
- Aggregated risk (script): probability=4.14, impact=4.14 → score=17 (High).
- Top 3 risk drivers: Security & compliance; CLI/wl integration and permissions; Test coverage for edge cases.
- Mitigations: Harden prompt and add security review; prototype CLI integration early and add automation; require dedicated integration & e2e test pass before rollout.
