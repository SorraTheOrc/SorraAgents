Scripts
=======

This folder may contain executable scripts used by the skill for deterministic tasks. The primary script is located at the repository root path:

- `skill/create-worktree-skill/run.sh` — main orchestration script (already present in the repo root `skill/` directory).

If additional helper scripts are required in future they should be added here and referenced from SKILL.md.
