# Ralph

Use this skill when the operator asks to run `ralph <work-item-id>`.

## Behavior

1. Validate input id is provided.
2. Validate target stage is `plan_complete` or `in_review`; fail fast with actionable message otherwise.
   - At `plan_complete`: run full implement→audit loop.
   - At `in_review`: skip the first implement pass and audit immediately. If audit fails, start the implement→audit loop.
3. Scope is target + direct children only.
4. Run iterative loop:
   - delegate implement pass via `pi -p --mode json --model <model> "implement <id> ..."`
   - run `pi -p --mode json --model <model> "/audit <id>"`
   - persist structured report via `wl update <id> --audit-text "..."`
   - append AMPA-style comment once per unique audit payload
   - if audit has unmet/partial criteria, feed remediation into next implement pass
5. Exit on success, cancellation, or max attempts.
6. On success run checks; offer merge and only execute merge when `--confirm-merge` is provided.

## CLI

Run deterministic script:

```bash
python skill/ralph/scripts/ralph_loop.py <work-item-id> [--max-attempts 10] [--check-cmd "pytest -q"] [--confirm-merge] [--verbose] [--quiet] [--model opencode-go/glm-5.1]
```
