# Ralph

Use this skill when the operator asks to run `ralph <work-item-id>`.

## Command invocation and ID detection

The skill accepts a work-item id provided inline in the user's command. Supported invocation forms include:

- `/ralph <WORKITEM>`
- `ralph <WORKITEM>`
- `run ralph <WORKITEM>`
- `ralph loop <WORKITEM>`

A work-item id is any short token matching the Worklog id pattern used in your environment (for example `WL-1234`, `CG-0MP12H40Q003Y7OU`, or an 8+ char identifier). When an id is present in the command the skill will use it and will not prompt for an id. If no id is detected the skill will ask the operator to provide one (or permission to create one).

## Behavior

1. Detect a work-item id in the invocation if present; otherwise ask the operator for an id (or permission to create one).
2. Run deterministic script locally:

```bash
python skill/ralph/scripts/ralph_loop.py <work-item-id> --json
```
